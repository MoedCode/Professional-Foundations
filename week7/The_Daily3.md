# Pause and Reflect: The Daily 3
Don’t stop, don’t think, just write | Get out of your head and get into your body | Whoosah!

We heard the rumors. You like the Daily 3. So we’ll be bold and ask the BIG question:

How have you been doing the past 3 - 4 weeks?
We know it’s all an exciting concept and we are keen to hear your thoughts.

As you complete this content, take a moment to reflect on the following. We’d love for you to share these thoughts with your squad.

How have you been doing with each of the Daily 3?
What has been going really well for you?
What benefits have you seen in the past 3 weeks? Please be specific so we can also learn from you.
Which daily 3 practice has been the hardest for you? Why?
What obstacles prevent you from doing the Daily 3 each day? What is something new you could try to get on track with building these habits? (You know you best!)
How might you keep yourself motivated and inspired so that you continue to practice The Daily 3 long term?

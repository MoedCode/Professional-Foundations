Daily 3: Reflections & Personalization

# Week #7 Milestone Readiness
Week #7 Milestone is a submission of your/your team’s wireframes or 3D prototype, a slide deck of your solution pitch, and a reflection on how things are going with your team.

As usual, every team member must submit their own milestone, but some portions of the work can be shared (specifically, creating the wireframes / 3D prototypes and making the slide deck).

Your Week #7 Milestone submission will be a Google doc (that you convert to pdf) that includes:

Steps 1-4
If creating Wireframes:

Images of each screen (or page) of your wireframes, including indications of navigation functionality, elements, and annotation. You should have at least 6 images. Detailed instructions on how to do this are found in this week’s content here on Savanna.
Optional: A 60-second (or less) video  similar to [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y20E3qBmHpg&ab_channel=CormacR).(Upload the video to YouTube and provide a link in your Google Doc.
Answer the questions mentioned in the milestone.
If creating a 3D Prototype:

Create a video lasting no more than 60 seconds that shows your prototype in action. Detailed instructions on how to create your 3D prototype are found in this week’s content here on Savanna.
The video should provide a full 360-degree view of your prototype and at least 1 function that it has.
Upload the video to YouTube and provide a link in your Google Doc.
Answer the questions mentioned in the milestone.
Steps 5-6
Link to the slides your team created as part of your team activity “[Create Your Pitch Slide Deck](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/105078)”. Ensure all items in the activity are covered.

Step 7
Your reflection on how things are progressing in your team.

Step 8-11
Convert the document to PDF and submit.


# Team Online Activity: Create Your Pitch Slide Deck
This activity is specifically designed for the team members who will be developing the Slide Deck. However, it is important for all team members to study this section, be involved in the creation and finalization of the slides, and familiarize themselves with the various elements of the final team slide deck. By doing so, every team member will be well-informed and able to provide valuable feedback during the slides review process.

Even if you are not directly involved in developing the slide deck, you are required to provide constructive feedback based on the presentation guidelines we listed here and collaborate effectively with your team. Also, your input based on your pitch outline will make the final slide deck much more impressive.



The roles responsible to lead this activity
Slide Deck Masters - These team members are responsible for creating a visually stunning and captivating slide deck while other team members focus on the other team outputs for this week.
Before You Start Creating Your Deck
1 or more team members will collaborate to create this slide deck, so here are guidelines you need to put in place to ensure consistency and coherence in developing a slide deck together.

1. Start by selecting a slide deck template that suits your presentation’s theme and objectives. You can use a pre-designed template from Google Slides, create a custom template or use an AI slide generator like

2. As the Slide Creation Team, you should define a consistent structure for each slide. The number of slides, order, and flow are already outlined in the slide creation activity below. You might want to decide how many slides in total you will need for Step 8 (Wireframes or 3D prototype pictures).

3. Establish guidelines for visual consistency. Decide on a colour scheme and specify which colours should be used for headings, text, and backgrounds. Determine font styles and sizes for headings and body text. Ensure that the chosen visuals, such as images or icons, align with the overall theme. This is very important. You want your slide deck colours and font to be consistent so they are not distracting.

4. Be clear on the content to be included on each slide. Looking at each of the required slides in the question below, decide which elements of your research, data visuals and prototype will be included.

5. Decide on a method for collaboration and version control. Consider using Google Slides, to work together in real-time and easily access the previous versions. Assign specific sections or slides to each team member and establish a clear workflow for reviewing and incorporating feedback. One person can tackle slides 1 - 6 while another team member completes slides 7 - 12.

6. Review each other’s work and provide feedback. Make sure you keep an eye out for consistency and alignment with the overall presentation’s objectives. The entire team should also see the slide deck and give its feedback and final approval. You must have review deadlines so that the final version incorporates all necessary changes.

Okay, now that you are organized, are you ready to create that compelling deck? Let’s do it!

Slide Deck Requirements
You are encouraged to be creative with your slide deck and to add more elements from your pitch ideation sessions, than appear below. But the minimum criteria for your slide deck are as follows:

Slide 1:
Title Slide

Include a project name and the names of all team members.

Slide 2:
State your problem in 1 sentence.

State the GCGO that is related to.

Then briefly describe WHY your problem matters in 1-2 sentences. Challenge yourself to state your WHY as clearly and succinctly as possible.

Slide 3:
Make it personal. Describe 1 person or 1 specific group of people impacted by this problem and how it impacts them. You already created a user persona for your problem and solution at the beginning of Week 7. You can use that User Persona here.

Slides 4-6:
On each of these slides, present 1 piece of factual information that your web research in Week 5 revealed about your problem. Consider including a graph or other data visualizations if you present numerical data. (You also already have these visuals from the work you did in Week 5.)

Share only compelling, relevant, and accurate information.

Cite reliable sources as footnotes.

Slide 7:
Share at least 2 needs and pain points (challenges, concerns, frustrations) shared by your users during your user interviews in Week 5.

Slides 8-9:
State what your proposed solution is.

State WHY you chose this solution and why it is likely to be effective.

Slide 10:
Show us your solution.

If your solution is a 3D Prototype, include at least 3 clear photos of your prototype. Your photos must show the prototype functionality and user touchpoints as much as possible. Add extra pages as needed

If your solution is wireframes, include at least 3 clear images of each screen/page of these wireframes.  (Add extra pages as necessary)

Slide 11:
Share what you would do next if given funding to continue to work on your solution. Think big!

Slide 12:
Return to your WHY. Restate your WHY and share why your solution could make an important difference.

Slide 13:
(Optional) Appendix. Capture any elements that you feel are important but didn’t get to share in the body of your presentation. For example, you may include additional data or facts about your problem or solution(s), information about similar solutions shown to be successful, identify unknowns and/or unanswered questions, list organizations that are doing similar work, etc.

Once done share the link to the slide deck with your team. All team members must be able to view it so they can share feedback or make recommendations.

# Week #7 Milestone
Your Week #7 Milestone is a submission of the wireframes or prototype that you and/or your team created, and the pitch deck you and your team developed, along with a reflection on your team’s work.

Step 1.
Make sure your team and/or you have completed your wireframes or prototype, by checking off all the steps in the [Wireframe & Prototype Checklist]

Markers or pens
Sticky notes
Glue and/or duct tape
(etc)
Decide on which team will bring what. One person can bring everything or each person can bring something. It is up to the team. But it is always good to have redundancy in case someone doesn’t show up.
At least 3 people should create individual sketches that the team will be using to build their prototype


During Your Team Meeting (Together as a Team)
Review everyone’s sketches and as a group, discuss what you like about each prototype
Make decisions about how you will build the prototype and what functionality it will have (no electronics are required)
Using cardboard and/or other inexpensive materials (be creative!), create the prototype as a team
Evaluate what you have built. What do you like about it? What do you dislike?
Depending on how it turns out and how much time you have, you may be inspired to build the next version and make it even better. (optional)

After Your Team Meeting
Each team member should author a few questions for your user interviews.
As a team, select  4-6 questions that you will ask your users.
Conduct your user interviews: Show your prototype to at least 2 potential users, explain its use & ask your questions. (2 interviews minimum per team, not per person)

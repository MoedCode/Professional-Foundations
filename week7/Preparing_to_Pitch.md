# Audience Awareness Recap


To improve on your story, it is also important to think about the audience that will be hearing it. To do so, you can ask yourself the following questions about your audience:

Role: What are the individual or group’s goals and objectives?
Triggers: What messages does this individual or group wish for you to prioritize/avoid?
Needs:What are their pain points/desires & how can you address them?
Communication Style: How does this individual or group like being spoken to?
Value to You: What do you want from this individual/group and how would that change the way you position the story?
Before we give an example using the above thought processes, we just want to be sure you remember from Month 1 that your Stakeholders and your audience are not always the same.
Stakeholders are those directly impacted by the problem you’re addressing, while the audience refers to the individuals you are sharing your story with.

Stakeholders: These are the individuals or groups directly affected by the problem and this includes your users. When considering the impact on stakeholders, think about their experiences, challenges, and needs related to the issue. Understanding their perspective will help you create a more impactful and relevant story.

Audience: Your audience is the group of people you are presenting your story to. They may include stakeholders, as well as others who may not have direct involvement but have an interest in the topic. For your pitch this week your audience will be your employer. Your goal as a team is to get funding from your employer to develop your innovation solution further. They don’t know what it’s all about so you will need to tell a story that begins with your problem, the affected user, the research you conducted, your solution and why you will think it will work.

Okay, now that we are all on the same page again, let’s walk through an example of the 5 questions we listed above.

# Audience Expectations & Needs
Considerations:
Role: What are the individual or group’s goals and objectives?
Triggers: What messages does this individual or group wish for you to prioritize/avoid?
Needs: What are their pain points/desires & how can you address them?
Communication Style: How does this individual or group like being spoken to?
Value to You: What do you want from this individual/group and how would that change the way you position the story?
Scenario:
For example, pretend you are a Kenyan startup founder speaking to a wealthy business owner based in the US about donating a small amount to your company as a philanthropic gift. Your startup involves selling a financial education app to schools and institutions to help young people with basic financial literacy skills and knowledge. To prepare an effective pitch you would first make these considerations:

Role: Perhaps the business owner wants to find a way to bring good press for his company through this donation, or he simply wants to donate to support a cause he believes in; if the latter, perhaps you can focus more on the big vision of the organization and how it can change the trajectory of a young person
Triggers: You know that the business owner came from humble beginnings, so perhaps you can focus on how your startup helps young people from low-income backgrounds manage their finance better
Needs: Perhaps this business owner is at a point in his life when he wants to give back and feel connected to the youth; Perhaps you can then focus on how the donation can impact a specific group of young people specifically and highlight the story of one particular person you are already working with
Communication Style: As a business owner, this person probably wants to understand exactly how their donation will be used – they want the “ask” to be stated upfront, clearly and directly
Value to You: Your end goal is to secure the donation, so you are hoping to make clear what impact the funding will have.
Effective communication is a powerful tool that can open doors and create lasting impact.
By considering these 5 questions and crafting your pitch accordingly, you’ll increase your chances of obtaining your desired outcome.

# Your Team's Compelling Story


Now that you have a clear picture of your audience and their needs and expectations, you can start working on:

The story you want to tell as a team.

How to tell that story in the most compelling way.

In our case, you will be making a pitch to your audience (your employer). Your goal is to tell a story that showcases the preliminary wireframes/ 3D prototype that your team developed, the rationale behind it and why you think the company should provide funding to move the project forward.

Your employer’s goal is to understand:

The problem you identified and whether it is in their interest,
The validating data that explains the problem
Your user (as represented by your team’s user persona)
The solution you recommend
The rationale behind your solution
Whether it is at all viable
How you would carry the project forward if funding is provided.
The employer also requires a preliminary visual of your 3D prototype or set of wireframes and initial user testing feedback.

With this in mind let’s explore how you might make your pitch through storytelling and a slide presentation.

If you still don’t know where to start, don’t worry. We will learn about how to create a powerful message using a story outline and share a simple worksheet that you can use to start working on the pitch outline for your team.

# A Powerful Message
The first step to a powerful presentation is to determine the set of messages you want to share with your audience. A powerful message is:

Simple
Memorable
Clear
Unexpected (at times)
Watch the video below to understand how to create a powerful message. As you watch ask yourself:

How long can I talk before losing my audience?
What are the 5 considerations that I need to make to deliver a powerful and engaging message?

You’ll see that a lot of the tips shared in the video above are related to knowing your audience. As we have mentioned before, your messages need to be tailored to the audience you are speaking to.

the attention span of a goldfish is 9
seconds but a human's is 8 seconds it
isn't easy to catch someone's attention
but it is possible in 90 seconds this
video explains a five-step process for
creating a message that connects with
your target audiences and causes them to
act step one identify the action you
want to to happen when you communicate
it's usually because you want something
done you want people to act so Define
that action very specifically it drives
the rest of the process okay now who can
make that action happen either directly
or through their influence on others
identifying those people is step two but
why would these people act that's step
three identifying the motivating desires
of those people focus on their desires
not their needs because people act
faster to satisfy desires than needs
step four is a pause to find if there's
overlap between your desire and theirs
can you meet their desires if not stop
even the most clever message won't help
you if you can go on to step five and
write the message make it short you're
just connecting at this stage not having
a full conversation make it
conversational so it's easy to
understand make it simple use words
they're comfortable with and most of all
Focus what you say on what they want
their priorities Drive what you say not
the other way around

# Persuasive Appeal Recap
Remember the 3 “persuasive appeals” that can make your message more effective? These are ethos, logos and pathos!

Rewatch this video from Month 1 that outlines each of these appeals.As you watch, ask yourself to make a note of each appeal and ask yourself

What are the main differences between each appeal?
What presentation scenario can each appeal be used successfully?
Which appeal method, if any do we want to use in our message?


question mark
As you complete this content, put a bit more thought into the following:

Which one do you think will be the most effective for you and your team right now?
Finally, you can ensure maximum effectiveness for your story if you are clear on the key messages you want to make sure your audience hears/understands/realizes.

Part of this is thinking through how you want your audience to FEEL, what you want them to THINK and what you need them to KNOW after hearing your story. Once you understand these three things, you can work backwards to determine how you want to position the key messages of your story.

Let’s think about it…

If you want your audience to feel infuriated/angry after your presentation, maybe you focus on a story of injustice.
If you want your audience to think that they have a role they can play, maybe you can share a story of how one person was able to make a difference.
If you want your audience to know about how the system is broken, maybe you can focus on a story of inefficiency and wastage.
Makes sense, right? First, decide on the end goal of your story, and then work backwards to effectively shape and position your key message.

the three persuasive appeals logos ethos
and
posos 2,300 years ago famous philosopher
Aristotle argued that there were three
ways to persuade someone and these three
persuasion appeals are the same modes of
persuasion used today by politicians
advertisements and public speakers
alike the first persuasive appeal is
logos or logical appeal logos is
persuading by appealing to one's logical
side through reason often through facts
statistics charts and
graphs the second persuasive appeal is
ethos or credibility appeal ethos is
persuading by establishing that the
Persuader is trustworthy often through
showing where one's information came
from or by using an expert or
testimonial the last persuasive appeal
and often the most effective is posos or
emotional appeal
p is persuading by appealing to one's
emotions and by creating an emotional
response such as sadness or
happiness it is also important to note
that good persuaders keep in mind the
target audience when using logos ethos
and posos this is called audience
awareness after all it wouldn't make
sense to show a toy commercial during a
late night talk
show in the end it's important to use a
balance of all three persuasive appeals
this will keep your audience engaged
while keeping their trust in
you so next time you're aiming to
persuade someone use all three
persuasive appeals then you can tell
everyone you're cool like
Aristotle

# Creating a Storytelling Outline Recap
And here is another memory jog from Month 1…

This next video, which we shared in Month 1, will show you how to create a storytelling outline for a presentation. Watch it again and make special note of the 5 different stages the video recommends as the best way to outline a presentation.


Let’s recap in one simple sentence:

Tell them what you are going to say, say it, and then tell them what you just said.
The video also mentioned that there are approximately 26 ways to outline a presentation. We want to make this simpler for you so we will share, in the next few pages, a [presentation outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y0becJHrPHiwMWMFaa026eHpR0wJWc9Wf3xWVuExlyg/copy) that you can use to plan your team’s presentation speech.

Happy Outlining!

Stephanie asked what's the best way to
outline a presentation that's actually a
fantastic question I'm glad you asked it
all right so I've been on record or I've
gone on record a few times saying that
there's about 26 different ways in which
you can outline presentation content now
my personal favorite of that batch is to
do a format that is actually quite well
known but nobody actually applies it and
it's tell them what you're gonna say say
it and then tell them what you just said
so let me repeat that
tell me what you're gonna say say it and
then tell them what you just said
so how that looks in a business context
or at least in our presentation context
is you want to sort of structure your
presentation around five simple stages
so Stage one you want to tease your idea
this is where you can set up your
problem in your solution maybe through a
creative story or something similar then
stage two is where you get into the
first component of telling them what
you're going to say this is where you
preview your content so in this case you
can say today I want to talk about X Y &
Z now stage three you get into informing
and igniting you're basically walking
them through X Y & Z so you just may
spend five minutes on topic X another
seven minutes on topic wide maybe three
minutes 10 minutes on topic Z but you're
telling them what these three points are
all about and then you get into stage
four where you're essentially reviewing
everything you just talked about so
thank you everybody
we talked about today XY and Z and then
finally you get into stage five where if
you've been a big follower of mine
hopefully you'll have a call to action
that now that you've learned about X Y &
Z this is what you need to go do with it
all right so that is sort of what I
would recommend really is sort of the
best way to structure and organize your
presentation moving forward

# Pitching to Tech Leadership
At times, you’re going to pitch to business leadership in a company, and at other times, you might need to advocate for your idea among senior tech leaders. These leaders might include roles such as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Product Officer, Engineering Manager, and Director of Product.

Whether you’re an aspiring entrepreneur or a team member with an innovative idea, knowing how to pitch to tech leadership can mean the difference between getting your ideas noticed and having them fall by the wayside.

![alt text](image-5.png)

Effective communication and persuasion skills are essential for professionals looking to make a significant impact in the tech industry. In this lesson, we’re going to go about learning the best way to do this.

Here are some of the considerations to make before pitching to technology leadership:
1. Understand your audience: Research and gather information about the individuals you will be presenting to, such as their backgrounds, interests, and areas of expertise. Tailor your pitch to align with their goals and challenges, ensuring that your proposal addresses their specific needs. For example, imagine you’re pitching a cybersecurity solution to your company’s CTO. Research the company’s recent security breaches or challenges and highlight how your solution directly addresses those issues. By showcasing your understanding of their pain points, you can establish credibility and capture their attention.

2. Clearly highlight the problem and solution: Begin by illustrating the current challenges and their impact on the organization. Then, introduce your solution as a means to address these pain points and demonstrate its potential benefits. For example, suppose you are pitching a new project management software to the head of product development. Start by discussing the common problems faced by project managers, such as missed deadlines and communication gaps. Present your software as an intuitive and collaborative tool that streamlines project workflows, enhances communication, and ultimately improves overall productivity.

3. Highlight the value proposition: Tech leaders are often focused on the bottom line and ROI (Return on Investment). Emphasize the value proposition of your proposal by clearly outlining the tangible benefits it offers. Whether it’s cost savings, increased revenue, improved efficiency, or enhanced customer experience, tie your solution to specific metrics that resonate with tech leadership.  For example, if you’re pitching a cloud migration strategy to the CEO of a software company, highlight how the migration will reduce infrastructure costs, improve scalability, and enable faster time-to-market for new product features. Showcasing the potential financial gains and competitive advantages will increase the likelihood of buy-in from tech leadership.

4. Demonstrate expertise and credibility: Establish your expertise and credibility by providing evidence of research done to show instances where your idea has helped other teams improve. Share relevant success stories, case studies, or testimonials to demonstrate that this is the right idea to solve a particular problem. For example, suppose you are pitching a machine learning algorithm to optimize a company’s supply chain to the Chief of Product. Highlight your team’s experience in successfully implementing similar algorithms in the company, along with measurable results such as cost savings, reduced lead times, or improved inventory management.

5. Anticipate questions and objections: During your pitch, anticipate questions or objections that tech leadership might have. Prepare solid answers that address potential concerns and show that you have thoroughly considered all angles. Be open to feedback and demonstrate your willingness to collaborate and adapt your proposal based on their input. For example, when pitching a new mobile app feature to the Head of Analytics, anticipate questions about user adoption and return on investment. Provide data on competitor adoption rates, user engagement statistics, and revenue growth resulting from similar feature implementations in the market. This proactive approach will instil confidence in your ability to address their concerns.

As the above points mention, remember to tailor your pitch (to your audience), clearly define the problem and solution, highlight the value proposition, demonstrate expertise, and anticipate objections. With practice and persistence, you can master the art of pitching to tech leadership and turn your innovative ideas into reality.

How do you think pitching to tech leadership differs from pitching to business leadership?

 we shared, to create a pitch outline that your team should use for the pitch video.

Your outline must do the following:

1. Take the slide deck preparation requirements into consideration. You can view these under the Team [Online Activity: Create Your Pitch Slide Deck](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/105078) activity.
```
Team Online Activity: Create Your Pitch Slide Deck
This activity is specifically designed for the team members who will be developing the Slide Deck. However, it is important for all team members to study this section, be involved in the creation and finalization of the slides, and familiarize themselves with the various elements of the final team slide deck. By doing so, every team member will be well-informed and able to provide valuable feedback during the slides review process.

Even if you are not directly involved in developing the slide deck, you are required to provide constructive feedback based on the presentation guidelines we listed here and collaborate effectively with your team. Also, your input based on your pitch outline will make the final slide deck much more impressive.



The roles responsible to lead this activity
Slide Deck Masters - These team members are responsible for creating a visually stunning and captivating slide deck while other team members focus on the other team outputs for this week.
Before You Start Creating Your Deck
1 or more team members will collaborate to create this slide deck, so here are guidelines you need to put in place to ensure consistency and coherence in developing a slide deck together.

1. Start by selecting a slide deck template that suits your presentation’s theme and objectives. You can use a pre-designed template from Google Slides, create a custom template or use an AI slide generator like

2. As the Slide Creation Team, you should define a consistent structure for each slide. The number of slides, order, and flow are already outlined in the slide creation activity below. You might want to decide how many slides in total you will need for Step 8 (Wireframes or 3D prototype pictures).

3. Establish guidelines for visual consistency. Decide on a colour scheme and specify which colours should be used for headings, text, and backgrounds. Determine font styles and sizes for headings and body text. Ensure that the chosen visuals, such as images or icons, align with the overall theme. This is very important. You want your slide deck colours and font to be consistent so they are not distracting.

4. Be clear on the content to be included on each slide. Looking at each of the required slides in the question below, decide which elements of your research, data visuals and prototype will be included.

5. Decide on a method for collaboration and version control. Consider using Google Slides, to work together in real-time and easily access the previous versions. Assign specific sections or slides to each team member and establish a clear workflow for reviewing and incorporating feedback. One person can tackle slides 1 - 6 while another team member completes slides 7 - 12.

6. Review each other’s work and provide feedback. Make sure you keep an eye out for consistency and alignment with the overall presentation’s objectives. The entire team should also see the slide deck and give its feedback and final approval. You must have review deadlines so that the final version incorporates all necessary changes.

Okay, now that you are organized, are you ready to create that compelling deck? Let’s do it!

Slide Deck Requirements
You are encouraged to be creative with your slide deck and to add more elements from your pitch ideation sessions, than appear below. But the minimum criteria for your slide deck are as follows:

Slide 1:
Title Slide

Include a project name and the names of all team members.

Slide 2:
State your problem in 1 sentence.

State the GCGO that is related to.

Then briefly describe WHY your problem matters in 1-2 sentences. Challenge yourself to state your WHY as clearly and succinctly as possible.

Slide 3:
Make it personal. Describe 1 person or 1 specific group of people impacted by this problem and how it impacts them. You already created a user persona for your problem and solution at the beginning of Week 7. You can use that User Persona here.

Slides 4-6:
On each of these slides, present 1 piece of factual information that your web research in Week 5 revealed about your problem. Consider including a graph or other data visualizations if you present numerical data. (You also already have these visuals from the work you did in Week 5.)

Share only compelling, relevant, and accurate information.

Cite reliable sources as footnotes.

Slide 7:
Share at least 2 needs and pain points (challenges, concerns, frustrations) shared by your users during your user interviews in Week 5.

Slides 8-9:
State what your proposed solution is.

State WHY you chose this solution and why it is likely to be effective.

Slide 10:
Show us your solution.

If your solution is a 3D Prototype, include at least 3 clear photos of your prototype. Your photos must show the prototype functionality and user touchpoints as much as possible. Add extra pages as needed

If your solution is wireframes, include at least 3 clear images of each screen/page of these wireframes.  (Add extra pages as necessary)

Slide 11:
Share what you would do next if given funding to continue to work on your solution. Think big!

Slide 12:
Return to your WHY. Restate your WHY and share why your solution could make an important difference.

Slide 13:
(Optional) Appendix. Capture any elements that you feel are important but didn’t get to share in the body of your presentation. For example, you may include additional data or facts about your problem or solution(s), information about similar solutions shown to be successful, identify unknowns and/or unanswered questions, list organizations that are doing similar work, etc.

Once done share the link to the slide deck with your team. All team members must be able to view it so they can share feedback or make recommendations.
```

You will need to use your team’s completed slide deck to write down your main message in the presentation outline. You will work on your slides next in Canvas. For now, just complete the “Body” of your outline by looking at the slide deck requirements. You can come back to your main message after the slide deck is complete.

2. Take your audience into consideration. You can ask the 5 key questions to do this:

Role: What are the individual or group’s goals and objectives?
Triggers: What messages does this individual or group wish for you to prioritize/avoid?
Needs: What are their pain points/desires & how can you address them?
Communication Style: How does this individual or group like being spoken to?
Value to You: What do you want from this individual/group, and how would that change the way you position the story?
Each team member must create a pitch outline and share it with the team.
Later this week, the team will decide on a message and one outline to use for the pitch.

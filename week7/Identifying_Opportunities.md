Analytics is the next big thing for business  and want to find more about what the field
involves by the end of this video you should have  a better understanding of what data analytics is
and you'll have a better understanding  of what you'll be doing in the role
in this video we're going to cover five key points  to give you a better understanding of what it is
to be a Data Analyst and how do you start working  in this field as you're watching the video if
you've got any questions about the topics that we  cover just drop them in the comments below before
we dive in if you're enjoying the video content  please give us a like and subscribe to get more
weekly videos like this so let's dive into step  number one perhaps you're thinking about becoming
What is data analytics
a data analyst and want to know exactly what a  career in the field involves most companies are
collecting loads of data all the time but in its  raw form this data doesn't actually mean anything
this is where data analytics comes in data  analytics is the process of analyzing raw data
so that we can pull out insights which are useful  to companies these insights are super important to
drive smart business decisions what a data analyst  does is they take all this complex jigsaw of data
they take it out and they make it into  something which you can really use
having interpreted the data the data analyst can  then pass these insights on so that the company
can then make the most informed decisions  so you can think of data analytics as a
kind of business intelligence used to solve  problems and challenges that every company has
it's all about finding patterns in the data which  can tell you something useful or relevant about
the business operations so for instance how  customers engage with a particular product or
employees engage with a particular tool armed with  the insights of data companies are then able to
make better decisions about their audience company  as a whole and the industry in which they work in
What are data analytics used for?
Step one we looked at what Data Analytics  actually is in step two we're going to look
at how data analytics is used so what does data  analytics actually look like in action and how is
it used in the real world so the fact is data is  everywhere so it actually has an infinite amount
of uses across all kinds of businesses and  organizations globally broadly speaking data
analytics is used to make faster and better  business decisions to reduce overall business
costs and to develop new and innovative products  and services in more specific terms data analytics
might be used to do the following to predict  future sales or purchasing behaviors for security
purposes to help and protect against fraud to  analyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns
to boost customer acquisition and retention or  to increase supply chain efficiency so that gives
you a little bit of an overview of what data  analytics can be used for in the real world
What does a data analyst do?
Step three let's dive into what a data  analyst actually does on a day-to-day basis
if you're thinking about becoming a data analyst  you're probably interested in the roles and
responsibilities that you'll have in the field  based on some real job ads here are some typical
roles and responsibilities that you'll have to  undertake as a data analyst manage the delivery
of user satisfaction surveys and report on  results using data visualization software
work with business line owners to develop  requirements define success metrics
manage and execute analytical projects and  evaluate results monitor practices processes
and systems to identify opportunities for  improvement translate important questions
into concrete analytical tasks gather new  data to answer client questions collating
and organizing data from multiple sources  design build test and maintain back-end code
establish data processes define data quality  criteria and implement data quality processes
work as part of a team to evaluate and analyze key  data that will be used to shape future business
strategies so those are just some examples of what  a data analyst would be doing in any given role
to learn more about the kinds of things that  you'll be undertaking as a data analyst why
not search on job boards like linkedin indeed  and icrunchdata.com so that was step three
it was just a broad overview of what you  can expect to be doing as a data analyst
Typical process of a data analyst
So now we've looked at data analytics as a role  we're now going to go into the process of data
analysis so now we're going to outline  the five main steps a data analyst would
take when approaching a new project step one  define the questions that you want to answer
you need to answer why you're conducting this  analysis and what questions and answers you
need to find at this stage you'll take a clearly  defined problem and then you'll make a hypothesis
or research question that you can go on and  answer you'll then need to identify what types
of data you'll need but importantly where it  will come from for instance a business problem
might be that customers aren't subscribing to  a paid membership once that free trial ends
your key question can then be what kind  of strategies can the business implement
to retain their customer base step two would be  to collect this data with a clear question in mind
you're ready to start collecting that data data  analysts will usually gather data from primary
sources or internal data that the company already  has such as CRM software or email marketing tools
they may tend to secondary or external sources  such as open data sources so this can include
data from government portals tools like  google trends but also data from international
organizations like the world health organization  so step three you need to clean scrub that data
once you've got that data you need to prepare  it and ready it for analysis your original data
might include duplicates anomalies or missing data  which could distort how the data is interpreted
these all need to be removed data cleaning can be  a manual task and it can take some time but it's
crucial if you want to get the right business  insights step four is to analyze the data now
for the actual analysis how you analyze the data  will depend on the question that you're asking
and the kind of data that you're working  with but some common techniques include
regression analysis cluster analysis and time  series analysis to name just a few we're going to
go into these analysis terms much deeper in future  videos but if you have any specific questions now
drop us a comment in the comments below moving  on to step 5 we need to interpret and share the
results the final step in this process is where  data is turned into valuable business insights
depending on the type of analysis conducted you'll  present your findings in a way that others can
understand in the form of a chart or a graph for  example at this stage you'll be able to say what
the data analysis actually shows you in regards  to your initial question or business challenge
and you'll collaborate with key stakeholders  on how to move forward this is a great moment
to reflect and look at the limitations of your  data and what further analysis might be conducted
The skills needed to become a data analyst
rounding off step four we're going to move  on to the next step what skills you need
to actually become a data analyst in addition to  the role description and the processes that we've
described so far data analysts are also expected  to demonstrate certain skills and abilities
here are some of the most important hard and soft  skills that you'll need to become a data analyst
you'll need to have some mathematical and  statistical ability data analysts spend a lot
of their time crunching numbers so you'll need to  have a mathematical brain you'll have to have some
working knowledge of programming languages such  as python oracle and sql data analysts rely on
a number of programming languages to carry out  their work this may seem daunting at first but
it's nothing that can't be learned over time with  practice you'll also need an analytical mindset
it's not just about crunching the numbers and  sharing your data sometimes you'll need to dig
deeper to understand really what's going on  it's all in the name an analytical mindset is
a must remember data analytics is about answering  questions and solving business challenges and that
requires some keen problem-solving skills data  analysts have a wide variety of tools at their
disposal and you'll need to know which one to use  and when you'll also need excellent communication
skills once you've harvested your data for  valuable insights it's important to share your
findings so that it benefits the business data  analysts work in close collaboration with key
business stakeholders and they may be responsible  for sharing their insights to those stakeholders
but also the entire company so if you're thinking  about becoming a data analyst you need to be
comfortable with this aspect of the job so that  summarises some of the key hard and soft skills
you'll require as a data analyst i hope this  has been a value obviously this isn't a broad

***Transcript***:

Hi my name is Will and i'm going to give
you a step-by-step guide to the  data analysis process, let's go!
in this video we're going to go through the five  key stages of the data analysis process we're
going to give you an overview and an introduction  to each of these stages as well as looking at some
of the tools you'll use to undertake these stages  so let's dive into step one defining the question
Step one: Defining the question
the first step in your data analysis process  or any data analysis process is to define your
objective in data analytics terms this is called  the problem statement defining your objective
means coming up with a hypothesis and figuring  out how exactly to test it you can start by asking
what business problem am i trying to solve now i  know this might sound straightforward but it can
actually be trickier than it seems for instance  your organization's senior management might pose a
question such as why are we losing customers it's  possible though that this doesn't get to the core
of the problem a data analyst job is to understand  the business and the business's goals as a data
analyst you need to understand this in enough  depth that they can frame the problem the right
way to give you a practical example let's say you  work for a fictional company for example we'll
call it top notch learning this fictional company  top notch creates custom training software for its
clients in this example top notch is excellent  at securing new clients but unfortunately top
notch has much lower repeat business as such as a  data analyst your question might not be why are we
losing customers but which factors are negatively  impacting the customer experience or even better
yet how can we boost customer retention whilst  minimizing costs now you've identified the problem
you need to find which data is going to help  you solve this issue this is where your business
acronym comes in again for instance perhaps  you've noticed that the sales pipeline for new
customers is very slick but the production team  is extremely inefficient knowing this you could
hypothesize the sales process actually wins a lot  of new clients but the customer experience well
it's kind of lacking could this be the reason that  customers aren't coming back what sources of data
will help you answer this question as a data  analyst considering all these things will help
you define the question and help you solve the  problem at hand there's also a number of tools
that can help you define your objective defining  your objective is mostly about soft skills so
business knowledge and lateral thinking but you'll  also need to consider business metrics and key
performance indicators and these are called KPIs  monthly reports can help you track problem points
in the business there are lots of tools out there  on the market that can analyze this business data
tools like Databox and DashaRoo there's also free  open source software like Grafana freeboard and
Dashbuilder these are fantastic for producing  simple dashboards both at the beginning and at
the end of the data analysis process so that was  step one defining the objective onto step two step
Step two: Collecting the data
two collecting the data once you've established  your objective you'll need to create a strategy
for collecting and aggregating the appropriate  data a key part of this is determining which
data you need this might be quantitative data or  numeric data eg sales figures or monthly reports
or qualitative descriptive data such as customer  reviews all of this data fits into one of three
categories first party second party and third  party data let's explore each one briefly now
what is first party data first party data is data  that you or your company has directly collected
from customers it might for example come in the  form of transactional tracking data or information
from your customer relationship management  system your CRM system whatever it source
first party data is usually collected in a clear  and structured way other sources of first party
data might include customer satisfaction surveys  focus groups interviews or direct observation
let's talk about second party data to enrich your  analysis you might want to secure a secondary data
source second party data is simply the first  party data of other organizations this might
be available directly from the company or from  private marketplace the main benefit of second
party data is that it's usually structured  and although it's less relevant than first
party data it tends to be reliable examples of  second party data include website app or social
media activity like online purchase history or  shipping data so lastly what is third-party data
third-party data is data that has been collected  and aggregated from numerous sources from a third
party often but not always third-party data  contains a lot of unstructured data or big data
many organizations collect this big data to create  industry reports or to conduct market research the
research and advisory firm Gartner is a good real  world example of an organization that collects big
data and then sells it on to other companies open  data repositories and government portals are also
sources of third third-party data let's take  a moment to look at some of the tools that you
can use to collect data once you've devised this  data strategy ie you've identified what data you
need and how best to go about collecting it there  are many tools that you can use to help you one
thing you'll need regardless of industry or area  of expertise is a data management platform or DMP
a DMP is a piece of software which allows you to  identify and aggregate data from numerous sources
before they're manipulating them segmenting them  and so on there are many DMPs available some
well-known enterprise DMPs include salesforce DMP,  SAAS and the data integration platform Xplenty if
you want to play around you can also try some open  source platforms like Pymcore or Dswarm on to step
Step three: Cleaning the data
three cleaning the data once you've collected your  data the next step is to get it ready for analysis
this means cleaning or scrubbing it and this is  crucial to make sure that you're working with
high quality data key data cleaning tasks include  removing major errors duplicates or outliers all
of which are problems when you aggregate data  from numerous sources removing unwanted data
points so extracting irrelevant observations that  have no bearing on your intended analysis bringing
structure to your data or general housekeeping  so for example fixing typos or layout issues
which will help you map or manipulate your data  more easily and finally it helps filling in major
gaps as you're tidying up you might notice that  important data is missing once you've identified
these gaps you can go about filling them a good  data analyst will spend about 70 to 90 of their
time cleaning data this might sound excessive but  focusing on the wrong data or analyzing error in
this data will severely impact your results it  might even send you back to square one so whatever
you do don't rush this step let's have a look  at some of the tools that you can use to clean
your data cleaning data manually especially large  data sets can be incredibly daunting but luckily
there are many tools available to streamline this  process open source tools such as open refine are
excellent for basic data cleaning as well as high  level exploration however free tools offer limited
functionality for very large data sets now i know  this sounds like a data zoo but python libraries
such as pandas and some r packages are better  suited to heavy data scrubbing you will of course
need to be savvy with languages alternatively  enterprise tools are also available for example
data ladder which is one of the highest rated data  matching tools in the industry there are many more
why don't you see which data cleaning tools you  can find online share your free tools in the
comments below so that was step three cleaning  the data on to step four analyzing that data
Step four: Analyzing the data
finally once you've cleaned your data now comes  the fun bit analyzing it the type of data analysis
you conduct largely depends on what your goal is  but there are many techniques available univariate
or bivariate analysis time series analysis and  regression analysis are just a few you might
have heard of more important than the different  types though is how you apply them this depends
on what types of insights you're hoping to gain  broadly speaking all types of data analysis fit
into the four following categories descriptive  analysis which is analysis which identifies what
has already happened this is a common first step  that companies do before proceeding with deeper
explorations diagnostic analysis where the focus  is on understanding why something has happened
it is literally the diagnosis of a problem just  as a doctor uses the symptoms to diagnose the
patient's disease predictive analysis which is  where you identify future trends by the analysis
of historical data predictive analysis is commonly  used by businesses to forecast future growth and
lastly prescriptive analysis which allows  you to make recommendations for the future
this is the final step in the analytics part  of the process but it's also the most complex
this is because it incorporates aspects of all  the other analyses that we've described today
step 5 sharing your results you've finished  carrying out your analyses you have your insights
Step five: Sharing your results
the final step of a data analysis process is to  share these insights with the wider world or at
least with your organization's stakeholders this  is actually more complex than just sharing the raw
results of your work it involves interpreting the  outcomes and presenting them in a manner which is
digestible to everybody that's in the room since  you'll also present your work to decision makers
it's very important that the insights that you  share are 100 clear and also unambiguous for
this reason data analysts usually use reports  dashboards and interactive visualizations to
support their findings how you interpret and  present results will often influence the direction
of the business depending on what you share  your organization might decide to restructure to
launch a new product or close an entire division  that's why it's very important to present all the
evidence that you gathered and not to cherry-pick  data ensuring that you cover everything in a clear
and concise way will prove that your conclusions  are scientifically sound and based on facts on the
flip side it's important to highlight any gaps  in the data or to flag any insights that might
be open to interpretation remember that honest  communication is an important part of the process
it will help the business but it will also help  you to excel at your job there's a ton of tools
for interpreting and sharing your findings these  tools are suited to different experience levels
but popular tools that require no coding skills  include Google Charts, Tableau, Datawrapper and
Infogram if you're familiar with python and  r there are also many data visualization
libraries and packages available for instance  check out the Python libraries Plotty, Seaborn
and Matplotlib whichever data visualization  tools you use make sure that you polish up your
presentation skills too visualization is great  but communication is key so hopefully now you

this video is for anyone who wants a
no-nonsense explanation of what data
science is and the type of work that
data scientists do maybe you heard of
data science and you wanted to learn
more maybe you work with a data
scientist and you want to better
understand their work maybe you even
have a goal of becoming a data scientist
this video was made for any of you and
probably a whole lot more people out
there too my name is Ken G and I'm a
data scientist and content creator in
general my mission is to help make this
field more accessible for everyone and
to be honest I'm also kind of making
this video for my parents so they'll
stop asking me what I do every time they
see me with that being said let's jump
right into it to understand what data
science is now I think it's important to
very briefly understand where it started
A (Very Brief) History
data science has been around for a lot
longer than most of us realized in 1974
the famous computer scientist Peter
nower proposed data science as an
alternative name for computer science
and strangely enough in 1985 CF Jeff woo
used this term as an alternative name
for a completely different field
statistics in one of his lectures as
well if it isn't obvious there's some
pretty killer foreshadowing here the
official title of data scientist was
first proposed by DJ ptil at LinkedIn
who would go on to become the first US
Chief data scientist under Barack Obama
while the origins of the field are
actually quite old the true evolution of
What is Data Science Now?
the field is relatively new there have
been dramatic changes in the way that
data science has been done over the last
10 years due to the massive advancements
in storage and Computing capacity these
rapid changes over a short period of
time are why people generally still
consider data science a new or evolving
discipline although it might have been a
coincidence that both computer science
and statistics were both called data
science by you know a couple of
professors a long time ago it's become a
reality data science is now a beautiful
hybrid of these two domains we also need
to include a little bit of pure math and
some business/ subject area domain
expertise to even things out within the
domain as well many people still insist
that data scientists is calling
statistics by a different name in 1985
that quite possibly could have been the
case during one of CF Jeff Woo's
lectures however I don't believe that
that is still true because of the huge
volumes of data and the increased
complexity of computing many of the
problems that data scientists face today
cannot be done without the help of
computer science and some Advanced
understanding of the unique domains that
they're operating within so in real
terms what is data science enough with
the history and the abstract stuff data
How Data Scientists Create Value With Data
science is an apply name field it's a
domain where we work with data to
generate some form of value and we use
scientific techniques to extract this
value let's expand on that a bit how do
you work with data to generate some
value the first way we generate value
from data is through collecting it while
it isn't necessarily a core role of all
data scientists some data scientists use
their skill set to collect information
this can be done through building
systems for data intake like web pages
or surveys or can be done through
scraping the internet scraping the
internet means that you're writing code
that collects data from different online
sources another basic way that a data
scientist can create value from data is
by organizing it the vast majority of
data in the world is unstructured
meaning that it has hasn't been
organized into a database some data
scientists can transform this
unorganized data into a structured
format making it far easier for other
people to analyze as part of this
process they can also clean the data by
correcting misspellings fixing errors
identifying duplicate records and
parsing out missing values a lot of
these tasks are handled by data
Engineers these days but they still fall
under that broader data science umbrella
if you want more details on the specific
roles within the data science umbrella
I've linked a video in the top right
corner uh specific on that the next way
that we create value from data is
through analysis simple analysis starts
with basic statistics for example if we
wanted to look at the average spending
of an online customer versus an inore
customer insights like these can help us
to make better informed decisions about
how we merchandise or how we Market or a
whole host of other things often the
best way to convey these insights is
through a beautiful data visualization
we also might want to see if an ad
campaign is effective or not we could
run an AB test to see which of two ad
placements IES the most value this is
where a lot of the science and the math
starts to pop up for something like this
we'd want to use scientific method and
Concepts like hypothesis testing to
evaluate if the differences between
groups or campaigns are meaningful after
data analysis we start to get into what
most people consider you know the sexy
stuff you know building predictive
models from past data data scientists
can often build models that predict
future outcomes at better than random
chance this allows businesses to
hopefully make better decisions about
how they'd allocate their resources for
example let's say we owned a farm and we
wanted to build a model to predict how
much fertilizer we'd need to purchase
each month especially if fertilizer has
a shelf life it could save us a lot of
money if we predict this amount of
fertilizer that we need very accurately
another example would be if we're
looking to franchise a new restaurant we
could in theory build a model that would
predict the return on investment based
on geography on traffic patterns and
demographics of this new location the
final main way that data scientists
create value from data is through
automation if we put some some of these
models that we're building into
production often they make
recommendations at a pace that far
exceeds humans a great example of this
would be Netflix they have machine
learning algorithms that recommend you
videos in real time for a person to do
this same service it would take well not
just one person it take thousands of
people and thousands of hours to just
constantly recommend these videos in
this case it takes for Netflix only a
few machine learning algorithms to do
this almost instantaneously and these
things pay off too according to some you
know random article I found on the
internet apparently Netflix
recommendation algorithm is worth over a
billion dollars per year to the company
so the process in which data scientist
Drive value from data that I just
described is often referred to as the
data science life cycle most
organizations follow this path they
collect data they organize the data they
analyze the data they build models on
the data and then they automate or
productionize those models some
companies haven't got to the predictive
or the automated part yet but hopefully
they'll be moving and trending towards
that path you're probably thinking can
we get it data scientists Drive value
along this pipeline but what problems
What Problems Can Data Scientists Solve?
can they actually help solve what does
this mean in real terms this is a really
important question for non- dat
scientists to understand there are two
main types of problems that data science
and machine learning are good at taking
on the first is supervised learning so
supervised learning serves to predict
specific outcomes we want to predict
things like if someone is wearing a face
mask or not or exactly how tall someone
is for for some reason supervised
learning means that we have data where
the outcomes that we want to predict are
labeled let's say that we wanted to
predict if a papaya was ripe or not if
our papaya data had some characteristics
like length softness Mass sugar content
and if someone had labeled it ripe then
this could likely be used as a
supervised learning problem more
specifically this would be a
classification problem we're trying to
classify if a papaya falls into a ripe
or a not rpe category if we were trying
to predict how heavy the papaya is in
Gams then this would be what's called a
regression problem because we're trying
to predict a continuous numeric value
unsupervised learning is another story
with unsupervised learning we often
don't have predefined categories that
things neatly fall into instead we see
what data just naturally groups together
and we create new categories based on
the similarities and differences within
those data points an example would be a
simple customer segmentation maybe you
group customers based on their buying
patterns then you name those groups
based on the similar characteristics of
those buying pattern groups another form
of unsupervised learning is generative
where we're creating texts or images
from a model that's trained on a massive
Corpus on just a ton of data a popular
one now is called gpt3 and it's probably
just a little bit outside the scope of
this video you might have also heard of
deep learning or artificial neural Nets
these are so popular because they can be
generalized to solve almost any type of
supervised or unsupervised learning task
let me know in the comment section below
if you want me to make a video very
similar to this one explaining
specifically those Concepts I think it's
really important to understand the types
What Questions Can Data Science Answer?
of questions that machine learning and
data science are good for answering I
often hear non-data scientists speaking
about this field as a cur all or a
Panacea yes we can do some incredible
stuff but there are still limitations
based on the specific types of questions
we're asking of the data I have a great
case study of how data science can go
wrong with with poor assumptions that
I've linked in the top right corner so I
realize I've mentioned machine learning
quite a few times in this video I've
probably said it interchangeably with
data science in fact a few questions I
get a lot are what is machine learning
versus data science and how do machines
Machine Learning vs Data Science?
actually learn while I have a whole
video that goes more into the specifics
of this topic machine learning
algorithms are mainly what data
scientists use to build our models the
supervised and unsupervised learning
techniques that I listed above are all
machine learning on the other hand most
of the data analysis data collection and
data cleaning techniques don't fall into
that machine learning bucket for the
most part whenever we're making a model
that predicts future outcomes that
groups data points algorithmically or
generates new material that would be
considered machine learning but where
How Do Machines Learn?
does the learning take place Ken
whenever a data scientist build a model
they'll split their data into a train
and a test set they'll use their train
data to teach the model and then they'll
see how their model performs predicting
outcomes on the test set let's say we
want to build a model that predicts
someone's YouTube views based on how
many videos that they've made for
something like this we'd use a machine
learning technique called linear
regression with a simple linear
regression trading our model is just
fitting a line to these data points one
way of training this model is we'd use a
flat line and then we change the slope
and The Intercept of the model to reduce
the error or reduce how wrong we were
with each of the estimations that is how
our model would learn from this data in
order to make predictions on our test
set we just have to see the value of our
line based on the data point we're
selecting in our training set if our
model does a really good job at
predicting these test values then we
might consider it ready to apply to new
data with model training you'll hear
terms like overfitting and underfitting
and bias and variance trade-off I think
these are probably outside the scope of
the video but again let me know in the
comments section if you want me to make
a specific video on these Concepts they
they are relatively important so I'll
probably make a video on it anyway but
who knows you should hopefully
understand where data scientists create
value but what tools do they use and
What Tools Do Data Scientists Use?
what does their work look like in my
mind the most important tool in the data
scientist toolkit is programming most
data scientists use either python or r
with python being generally the more
popular language of the two other
languages are used like Scala Julia even
C C++ but it's usually for specific
domain use cases data scientists are
able to access the data manipulate it
create visualizations build models and
and productionize their models all
through coding programming is a data
scientists allpurpose tool however data
scientists also have specialist tools
that they use for getting and
manipulating data data scientists will
often use SQL this allows data
scientists to communicate easily with
databases where data is often stored
another specialist tool would be
something like Tableau or powerbi which
provide a graphic interface for creating
data visualizations and dashboards for
some projects there's so much volume of
data that data scientists need to use
more computing power in these cases
they'll access virtual computers owned
by Amazon Google or Microsoft these are
also known as Cloud providers to run
their analysis the last tool that's
becoming increasingly popular is git so
git is a versioning tool for people who
write code I have a full video pinned in
the top right corner for anyone who
wants a deeper dive on that so we build
these cool models but what does the real
end product of a data scientist work
What Do Data Scientists Produce?
look like honestly this varies pretty
greatly by role data science
deliverables generally come in three
flavors first they either have a
dashboard that guides business
stakeholders to their own insights or
that conveys information second they
have a deliverable that makes a
recommendation or prediction on a
specific problem finally they have a
train model that users can get real-time
predictions from it's really important
to understand that within this domain
there aren't really ever clear right and
wrong answers there are just shades of
certainty and uncertainty what I mean by
that is that a model that we build gives
us an estimate about what is likely to
happen the confidence of our model helps
us to decide if we should take action or
not in theory any model can be wrong
even if it's predicting I don't know if
the sun will come up tomorrow most
models that we build especially if
they're of the third variety and are
automated need to be consistently
maintained retrained and updated with
new data so that they're as accurate as
possible one of the most popular saying
in data science is that all models are
wrong but some are useful and I think
that that's really important to keep in
mind if you find all this very
interesting and you want to become a
data scientist I've linked a video on
how to approach learning the field in
the top right corner if just watching
this video is enough to expand your
knowledge I really appreciate you
sticking with me to the end hopefully
this help you to better understand data
science and some of the types of
problems that data scientists can help
solve if you think this video would be
helpful to one of your friends someone
you work with or someone who's looking
to become a data scientist i' I'd really
appreciate it if you forwarded it along

however one can here back with another
video for you today I'm talking about
the types of work that you can expect to
do as a data scientist and how much time
you can expect to actually spend on
these tasks as usual if you find this
content interesting please hit that like
button and if you want to see more
content like this please subscribe to my
channel so the first activity that
Project Planning
you're going to be doing as a data
scientist is project planning and I
expect this to take about from 0% to
about 20% of your time on a day-to-day
basis now in some companies this might
be reserved for more senior members but
I think in the most successful companies
everyone from the director of data
scientist of data science to a junior
data scientist would be involved in this
process this is thinking about the
prioritization of each of the projects
the grooming and gathering of the
requirements for you know the actual
projects as well so you can't expect to
do a reasonable portion of this but I
don't expect it to take a large portion
of your day most teams build this into
grooming sessions or have set aside time
to work on these activities the second
Data Cleaning
type of work that you can expect to do
as a data scientist gets a lot of talk
surrounding it and this is the data
cleaning data manipulation data
aggregation and the querying component
of data science it's all manipulating
and working with the data and you can
really expect to be doing this from
around 20% of the time to 60% of the
time it is a large component of what you
do I will say on different teams it can
really vary greatly so if you work in a
large corporation that has a data
engineering team they might be building
out tables in the database that you can
just select star from or you might
actually be querying all the data
yourself and even scraping the data and
bring it in and cleaning it so there's
gonna be a sizable element of this day
to day task in any data science role
that you are involved in I'm a big
believer that this skill is really
important to cultivate and
even put together a couple quick you
know video series about how to clean it
manipulate and aggregate data you can
see those above the next component of
Data Analysis
data science is actual data analysis
this is an algorithm building this is
looking at the characteristics of the
data and finding trends this is also
creating cool visuals for example in
tableau and power bi in our shiny or in
Python that plot lib plotly - etc
there's a lot of really cool stuff you
can do here and some data scientists
might be doing this almost full time I
would expect you to be spending between
10 and 50 percent of your time on this
type of activity to me the data analysis
is really where data science starts to
get fun there's an element of creativity
involved you also start to really learn
very interesting things that are that
can be actionable you don't have to
build a cool algorithm to be able to
create business impact you can separate
things into different groups and
understand the trends of each group and
that can create real business value so
you know some people might look down on
this and say oh you can do this in Excel
well that's absolutely true that doesn't
make it any less useful the next
Machine Learning
component is actually building machine
learning models and or deep learning
models basically model building in
general now this is after you've had the
clean data you're evaluating different
what what features are relevant to the
model what how you can tune the
parameters to make a model as successful
as possible and you're also trying to
understand the evaluation criteria as
well as possible you know you're looking
at things like accuracy precision recall
things like that and those are all very
relevant to the type of problem that
you're trying to solve so thinking about
a problem across all those different
dimensions is really important I don't
expect this to take you a tremendous
amount of time I mean there's great ways
to automate parameter tuning and great
ways to automate some of these other
things so I think most data scientists
spend around 10 to 40 percent of their
time focusing on this area and the last
Implementation
component is
is actually the implementation of the
models so this might be looked at by a
lot of people as an engineering task but
I think the onus is a lot more on the
data scientist or a machine learning
engineer to actually implement the
solution that they create so you have
this model now what do you do with it
you have to make it into an API endpoint
for a for another product to hit for
your webpage to hit or for for it to be
useful to someone so not all data
science comes out with an answer or
solution a lot of the time there is a
production model that is being used on a
day to day basis things are running in
real time live and that's an important
skill to cultivate and that's also
something that requires a lot of work a
lot of engineering so if you're a data
scientist this could take up from zero
percent of your time you know you're
just doing the the previous steps to
almost sixty percent of your time where
this is the main focus of your job is
taking models either you create or
others create and putting them into
production and making sure that they are
creating value for the business as you
Summary
can tell all of these things are part of
the data science lifecycle so you know
the planning data aggregation
descriptive statistics actual model
building and production ization
and that's how you should be framing
what your work is like I mean there's
people that do most of their work on the
front end of that cycle and then there
are people that do most of their work on
the latter latter half of that cycle and
when you're interviewing for a job or
when you're looking at a new position
that's something you should consider
where are you fitting into this cycle
and is that where you want to be in the
cycle you know some for some people the
data engineering component is very
interesting and for some people the like
implementation component is really
interesting so that's something you
should think about in terms of your own
goals your own likes and dislikes as
usual thank you so much for watching
this video and good luck on your data
science journey

# The Difference Between Data Analytics & Data Science
So how does ‚Äúdata analytics‚Äù differ from ‚Äúdata science‚Äù? Well‚Ä¶

via GIPHY

Data analytics is a subset of data science.
Data analysts typically examine existing data to find insights and answer specific questions on trends, patterns or relationships in that data.

The main goal of data analysis is to uncover meaningful information and provide valuable insights into what has already happened, potentially to inform future decisions.

Data analysis plays a vital role in many businesses, enabling organizations to uncover valuable understanding, insights, and improve decision-making, and drive business strategies.

while‚Ä¶

Data scientists typically have a more advanced skillset than data analysts. Their work usually encompasses a broader range of activities and includes data analysis, but also involves predictive modeling and algorithm development to make future predictions based on historical data.

Data scientists aim to extract knowledge from data to make predictions about future events or outcomes and often build data complex models, utilizing machine learning techniques.

what is crm
good question
crm stands for customer relationship
management it's technology that helps
you keep track of everything about your
customers and your potential customers
so you can build great relationships
with them
crm used to be all about sales
but not anymore
crm is for every department sales but
also marketing service
commerce and it2
a great crm helps you do amazing things
it centralizes all your important
customer information and company data in
one place
so your teams have the right information
to deliver the easy connected
experiences customers expect
take carol here carol owns a network of
scooter dealerships she has a lot of
customers
we just met one celeb
yesterday celeste configured the scooter
of her dreams 43 times
and because carol has crm her marketing
team knew it which is why celeste just
received an automated email that got her
off her couch and into a dealership to
take a test drive
when celeste arrives the scooter is
already waiting for her along with some
accessories the sales team knows celeste
is going to love
next thing you know celeste is buying
herself a scooter a snazzy helmet and
some really nice accessories but it's
not just sales and marketing who knows
celeste thanks to carol crm every
department knows her because every team
has one shared view of celeste and all
her information
before she's even made it back to her
couch service has already sent her tips
to help her care for her scooter
marketing uses built-in ai to predict
what celeste likes and suggests more
great additions
commerce uses the same insights to
create an entire storefront customized
just for her and i.t builds apps that
connect her to an entire community of
fellow scooter lovers friendship and
love follow brand love that is
along the way carol's crm just keeps
getting smarter and more helpful serving
up actionable analytics for everyone at
carol's dealership which makes carol's
employees happier and helps them
surprise and delight celeste again and
again the wright crm helps businesses
focus on customers and unites everyone
with one shared goal
make select or whoever your customer is
happy

- How would I describe being a Salesforce admin?
- Salesforce admins solve business problems
by customizing the Salesforce platform.
- We build, configure, and automate technology solutions
to deliver business value.
- This includes supporting our users, managing data,
maintaining a secure org,
and delivering actionable analytics.
- Every day can look extremely different.
- One day I might be discussing
a complex business process requirement.
The next it might be talking to a third party vendor
about how to integrate data into our org.
- We understand the business.
We know the technology.
And we know how to combine the two
so that we can reach success.
- I love being a part of a community
where we focus on helping each other succeed.
- With the awesome admin community,
my team, and the Salesforce technology to empower me.
I can do anything I set my mind to.

everyone welcome back to my channel my name  is emily and i talk a lot about salesforce
today we're going to be talking about  what do salesforce admins actually do
this is something that can get kind of confusing  um especially to people who are newer on the
salesforce ecosystem and they're wondering if  being a salesforce admin is right for them so
let's talk about a few things the main jobs  of or tasks i guess of a salesforce admin
Educate the users
so i have been a salesforce admin for about four  or five years now and before that i was a user on
the platform and so i have been on the salesforce  platform for about eight years it's been a really
great career for me and then transitioning  from the user to the admin side of things
was fairly easy for me because i did have that  background knowledge of being a salesforce user
beforehand but that kind of leads us into our  first topic that i do want to talk about it is
to educate the users salesforce admin is should be  working hands-on with the users to understand how
to best use the database this could be educating  them on the different fields that they should use
best practices on filling out each of these  fields how to use the different automations
in their day-to-day as well as just a general  i they haven't used salesforce ever before
how do they do their day-to-day selling or  servicing on the salesforce platform let me
take this example at one of my jobs a lot of  the sales users hadn't used salesforce before
so we would talk about how they were going  to sell and their selling process and come
up with a way together on the best ways to sell  using salesforce so specifically what we would
talk about is when they're on a call with a client  either on the leads object or on the opportunities
object what we do is they would go into their  notes and write down the notes uh the things
mentioned in the things mentioned in the call such  as other stakeholders or how much they're looking
to purchase or those kinds of things um and then  afterwards after the call when they were reviewing
their notes they would go in and take the things  that were in the description box or in their notes
Set up fields
and put it into the individual fields this way it  would save them time and it would save the company
a lot of money because they had all their data and  we could draw conclusions from the data that they
input into salesforce from their notes all right  let's move on and this is going to be for setting
up things like fields within salesforce fields  are just a little blur boxes that have a specific
type of data or information put into the database  so an example of this would be the amount field
on the opportunity that's a field this could also  mean putting together a formula field based upon
how many users they wanted or how many people they  wanted to sell to it could calculate how much it
was going to cost the client as well as how much  we should be selling the product for based upon
the amount of people that would be using it other  things that aren't necessarily fields could be
a whole new object an object is just  a fancy way of saying a group of data
things like contracts or deals deals being  opportunities prospects being leads within
salesforce one that's really common is projects  so let's say you wanted to house all of your
projects let's say you wanted to create a  project management system within salesforce
you'd be able to create a new object that was for  projects and then put the individual fields in
there as well so that's another thing a salesforce  admin does all right the third thing is going to
be creating automations in the past creating  automations has been a lot of different tools
but really it's just being narrowed down into one  specific tool and that is i guess two specific
Flows
tools and those are flows and approval processes  before it was flows rural processes workflow
roles and process builders but the process  builders and workflow rules are being phased out
flows and approval processes can do a lot of  really awesome things one thing i like to use as
an example is a renewal opportunity let's say your  company was selling a subscription-based product
and each year you needed to renew a contract you  would be able to create a new opportunity using
a flow to be put into the pipeline and onto  the schedule for next year so then the person
who's selling doesn't have to remember it this  also helps if someone leaves the company in the
process of something being renewed so then if they  were the ones who usually renewed that contract
you can move it on to someone else without losing  that client so that's just a quick example of a
automation number four is going to be listening to  your users about upgrades that they would like to
see within the system uh sometimes your users have  some really good ideas about one thing that would
make their life a lot easier this could be being  able to send out a contract through salesforce
or once an opportunity hit a certain stage then  the contract would be automatically sent out
to the client through salesforce to sign and  send back these are both really great things
that users have come to me in the past about  things that they want to see within the system
they're working with every day to save them a lot  of time and eventually the company a lot of money
because they could be using the time that  they're sending out the contract to sell more
all right number five this is  something that can be automated but
um doesn't necessarily need to this is going to  be creating users within the salesforce system
and creating all of their security permissions  making sure that they have access to the
things that they need to have access to if  you're in a very large system large company
with a large database then this is going to be  something that's probably going to be automated
but if you are in a midsize company this could be  something that you are doing every day as well as
resetting passwords helping troubleshooting issues  your users run into on a daily basis number six
this is going to be advising stakeholders on  the different things relating to the database
or to the system so oftentimes i've been in on  meetings where we are talking with the different
stakeholders and leaders within the company about  things that we can do to make the system better
and advising them on how much time is this going  to take is it worth the roi to spend this time
and development resources on this automation or on  this new tool if we could just have this be more
of a manual process and how easy is it going to  be to implement and train our users on how to use
that is another job of the salesforce admin to  help understand what kind of tools will it take to
create the projects that the higher level people  in the company may want to create so those are
the top six that i could think of uh things that  a salesforce admin would do on a day-to-day basis
now there are other things that you may do like  integrating different systems like integrating
docusign with salesforce or integrating maybe  mailchimp with salesforce or other different
marketing tools like outreach with salesforce  but these are the top six things that i have
mainly see in my day-to-day career as a salesforce  admin i hope that you found this video super
helpful if you did be sure to like it subscribe um  if you have any questions on other things that a
salesforce admin might do be sure to leave them  down below in the comments and i'll try to get

meet rob he runs an online shopping
portal the portal started with a modest
number of users but has recently been
seeing a surge in the number of visitors
on black friday and other holidays the
portal saw so many visitors that the
servers were unable to handle the
traffic and crashed
is there a way to improve performance
without having to invest in a new server
wondered rob
a way to upscale or downscale capacity
depending on the number of users
visiting the website at any given point
well there is amazon web services one of
the leaders in the cloud computing
market
before we see how aws can solve rob's
problem let's have a look at how aws
reach the position it is at now
aws was first introduced in 2002 as a
means to provide tools and services to
developers to incorporate features of
amazon.com to their website
in 2006 its first cloud services
offering was introduced
in 2016 aws surpassed its 10 billion
revenue target
and now aws offers more than 100 cloud
services that span a wide range of
domains thanks to this the aws cloud
service platform is now used by more
than 45 of the global market
now let's talk about what is aws
aws or amazon web service is a secure
cloud computing platform that provides
computing power database networking
content storage and much more
the platform also works with a
pay-as-you-go pricing model which means
you only pay for how much of the service
is offered by aws you use
some of the other advantages of aws are
security aws provides a secure and
durable platform that offers end-to-end
privacy and security
experience you can benefit from the
infrastructure management practices born
from amazon's years of experience
flexible it allows users to select the
os language database and other services
easy to use users can host applications
quickly and securely
scalable depending on user requirements
applications can be scaled up or down
aws provides a wide range of services
across various domains
what if rob wanted to create an
application for his online portal aws
provides compute services that can
support the app development process from
start to finish
from developing deploying running to
scaling the application up or down based
on the requirements
the popular services include ec2 aws
lambda amazon light cell and elastic
bean stock for storing website data rob
could use aws storage services that
would enable him to store access govern
and analyze data to ensure that costs
are reduced agility is improved and
innovation accelerated
popular services within this domain
include amazon s3 ebs s3 glacier and
elastic file storage
rob can also store the user data in a
database with aw services which he can
then optimize and manage
popular services in this domain include
amazon rds dynamodb and redshift
if rob's businesses took off and he
wanted to separate his cloud
infrastructure or scale up his work
requests and much more he would be able
to do so with the networking services
provided by aws
some of the popular networking services
include amazon vpc amazon route 53 and
elastic load balancing
other domains that aws provide services
in are analytics blockchain containers
machine learning internet of things and
so on
and there you go
that's aws for you in a nutshell now
before we're done let's have a look at a
quiz
which of these services are incorrectly
matched one
two
three
four
we'll be pinning the question in the
comment section comment below with your
answer and stand a chance to win an
amazon voucher

hey everyone this is lucy and today i'll
be talking about what a solutions
architect actually does at aws now this
is a highly requested video topic and
i've been getting this question ever
since i started my role as an associate
solutions architect at aws so i thought
i'd finally sit down and make a video to
address these three questions first of
all what does a solutions architect
actually do second of all what are some
of the roles and responsibilities of an
aws solutions architect and thirdly what
does my day look like as an associate
solutions architect at aws if you're
interested in learning more about the
role as a solutions architect the skills
required and how you can become a
solutions architect in 2022 make sure
you subscribe to the channel down below
and turn on notifications because i'll
be making videos about those topics very
very soon all right now let's head over
to the amazon jobs page
okay so according to the amazon's job
What does an AWS Solutions Architect do?
page the solutions architect team at aws
is responsible for helping customers
successfully implement cloud
technologies by partnering with internal
teams and leveraging a deep technical
knowledge of our tools and products
you'll craft highly scalable flexible
and resilient cloud architectures that
address our customers business problems
come join us in making the impossible
possible well that last sentence sounded
pretty cool and after working at aws for
around one and a half years now that
description actually makes a lot of
sense to me but i thought i add on to
this because after hearing about the
solutions architect role for the first
time it might be hard to figure out what
exactly we do and why aws actually needs
solutions architects in the first place
so without the help of a solutions
architect customers can still use the
products and services that aws offers
but with over 200 to choose from and
hundreds of pages of documentation about
how to use them it can be quite hard to
know what's the best solution for their
particular situation and this is where a
solutions architect comes in a solutions
architect is essentially a trusted
advisor for the customer as they go
through their journey with using the
cloud so aws solutions architects we
didn't actually go into the customer's
console and build everything out for
them we have other teams at aws to help
with that and we also collaborate with
other companies as well in order for
them to help the customer out with more
hands-on implementation but what we do
instead is we provide technical guidance
to help the customers make architectural
decisions that not only follow the best
practices but also making sure that the
solutions are secure performant cost
optimized and also fault tolerant now
when it comes to the roles and
Roles & responsibilities
responsibilities of a solutions
architect it does vary depending on the
team that you're in and the type of
solutions architect that you are so
there are many teams that we have at aws
there's the enterprise team there's a
smaller medium business team digital
native business team there are a few
different types of teams and these teams
are usually split up depending on the
different customers that we have at aws
but we also have other teams with
specialist essays that focus on a
specific knowledge domain for example
there's security specialist solutions
architects or solutions architects focus
more towards networking or databases but
generally speaking solutions architects
typically focus around half of their
time engaging with customers and helping
them out this could be through the form
of having a whiteboarding session where
you're showing them what an architecture
would look like if they were to move on
aws a solutions architect could also be
building out a proof of concept for a
customer and showcasing that through a
demo they could also be doing an
architectural review to help the
customers improve on their architecture
or they could be simply just helping the
customer out by answering some of their
questions either through email or
through a call so you might be wondering
well if half the time is spent with
customers what do essays do during the
other half of their time so the rest of
the time is typically split between
internal meetings speaking at events
writing blogs running technical
workshops sometimes mentoring other
solutions architects or even creating a
new program at aws that can provide some
sort of value at scale we also have
something we call sharpen the store time
where we cover up some time for learning
and this involves studying for adwords
certifications catch you up with new
product updates or diving deep into
learning more about a set of aws
services so the role of a solutions
architect really has many elements to it
part of it is talking to the customer
but as i mentioned there are also other
work that we do and so i wanted to share
What does my day looks like?
what my day-to-day looks like as an
associate solutions architect a couple
of months ago i uploaded a video showing
you a day in my life as an associate
solutions architect in the admiss techie
program but since then i've officially
graduated from that techie program and
joined my current team where i'm working
with customers and helping them
accelerate their cloud journey so as you
probably hear just like any other role
in the tech industry no two days are the
same the main distinction between an
associate solutions architect versus a
solutions architect is that we have a
lot more guidance and support when it
comes to learning so what i do is i can
spend a lot of my time doing shadowing
and reverse shadowing different
customers so if i ever want to receive
feedback on how i'm talking in front of
a customer and how i'm engaging with the
customer i can ask a more senior essay
to reverse shadow me and that way i can
get some feedback that's what i spend a
lot of my time doing these days still
doing a lot of learning doing aws
certifications my next goal is to
complete the advs security specialty
certification and there's also a lot of
meetings as well throughout the day in
the form of internal meetings team
stand-ups we also have a bunch of
customer meetings something else i'm
doing in aws is helping students and
people earning their career learn more
about cloud and also develop career
ready skills alright so this brings us
to the very end of this video thank you
so much for watching and if you have any

let's take a moment to understand what a
software engineer is so we can sort of
get a better idea of the big picture of
computer programming in general and you
might be thinking well don't software
engineers just write software and yes
that's true but there's so much more to
that story
so let's try and dissect it for our own
understanding engineering in general is
in a bare-bones sort of way the
application of scientific and
mathematical principles along with
experimentation to the design and
creation of things whether it's a civil
engineer designing a high-speed rail
system or an electrical engineer
designing a solar power system or an
aerospace engineer designing a new
Boeing aircraft the bottom line is that
something's being innovated designed and
built to solve some problem or fill some
need the interesting thing about
software engineers however is that the
things they create aren't as physically
tangible as all these other realms of
engineering software engineers are
creating worlds that are governed by
their own sets of rules and are powered
by computer systems in order to solve
problems much more efficiently than
humans can do on their own so here we
have a list of the sort of roles a
software engineer has to be able to
assume in order to properly complete his
or her job this list is taken from the
Java methods textbook by Maria and Gary
Levin and it really does a good job at
putting into perspective the scope of a
career in software engineering let's go
through them one by one and get a better
understanding of what each component
really means so we said that software
engineers are basically creating their
own worlds that are powered by computer
systems these worlds need some sort of
architecture in order to function
properly and as a result the software
engineer has to be the one to make sure
that all the data and all the
instructions in a software system are
represented properly and efficiently for
example let's consider Microsoft Word I
can type up some text in a Word document
I could add in some images I can make
hyperlinks I could cut and paste chunks
on my dock I could export as a PDF I
could send it to my printer I could add
comments there are a lot of features and
functions I need to happen in
conjunction in order for Microsoft Word
to be a useful program for me to use and
software engineers are the ones who are
creating that architecture in the
background so that can happen let's move
on to the next point when software
engineers are solving problems the
solution isn't easy to find for example
if an engineer at Lockheed Martin is
designing
some new tech that can detect missiles
and other dangerous objects and deal
with them accordingly it's going to need
a lot of different inputs from different
sensors and I'll need to take a lot of
calculations to determine the best
possible route to take
as a result that engineer has to be able
to write an algorithm to sort of
quantitatively document this procedure
that the computer software needs to go
through in general an algorithm is a
step by step recipe or set of
instructions that dictates how a certain
task should be done or how a certain
problem should be solved well how are
these algorithms written how's the
computer program written computer
programs are written in code but more
specifically in a programming language
and as a result a programmer needs to be
able to understand and use programming
languages throughout their career and
it's not like you learn Java once and
become a Java programmer for life
depending on your job your role in the
company or the project you're working on
you'll have to work with various
programming languages throughout your
life so that's what this third point
means syntax and style basically refers
to the quote unquote
grammar of programming language but keep
in mind what's more important is
understanding the concepts of
programming itself and once you have
that down you'll be much more adaptable
and flexible in learning the new
programming languages you'll come across
in the future when you're writing code
for programs however you're not just
typing inside of a Microsoft Word
document your code needs to be written
in a development environment based on
what language you're writing in and what
tasks you're trying to accomplish
which we can think of as sort of a
program inside of which we write our own
programs software engineers need to know
how to use these development
environments and all of their tools in
addition to development environments
software engineers also need to know
about available documentation which is
basically like reference books for code
and programming and reusable software
components which are chunks of code that
are already written since they're used
so often these make writing new code
much more efficient since you don't have
to reinvent the wheel every time you
gather what's already been written and
then build on top of that programs never
work the first time though and even if
it works for a certain amount of time
you might find a bug or your users might
report issues later down the road this
brings us to our next point software
engineers also have to be able to debug
their code basically they have to be
able to find and correct
any errors and programs at the end of
the day it's important to realize that
software engineers aren't writing
programs for other software engineers
they're writing them for everyday people
the quote-unquote users of these apps
and programs and devices that use
software in some way because of this
software engineers have to be careful to
make sure that their programs are
user-friendly meaning it's logical and
intuitive for ordinary people to use
when you open up Twitter or Google Maps
or Amazon on your phone you're usually
only a few clicks away from what you
want to do tap the search bar click the
messages icon swipe to the home menu
scroll through your shopping cart it's
all very easy to use regardless of
whether you've had the app for a day or
for a year update after update software
engineers have to be the ones to create
these user interfaces that seem so
natural and easy to use every time we
use these programs and this includes
things like the layout of buttons and
screens the colors and sounds the
different commands and just the overall
look and feel of the program in general
software engineering is arguably the
most rapidly changing field of
engineering if not the most rapidly
changing field in general and as a
result of this software engineers have
to be able to constantly learn and apply
new technical information whether it's
new hardware developments or new
programming languages or new algorithms
and techniques or new user demands or
new design aesthetics software
development is always changing and
software engineers have to be ready to
keep up and constantly learn new things
so that's a lot of responsibilities like
any field in the real world software
engineering requires an understanding of
a lot more than just info you find in a
textbook it encompasses the development
of system architectures the creation of
effective algorithms fluency in
programming languages debugging of
computer programs understanding of
development tools and the ability to
cater products to clients and users the
term software engineer itself is a big
category a lot of different types of
jobs maybe you're a web developer or fun
under back-end or a full stack developer
maybe do iOS maybe Android maybe
specialize in AI or machine learning
maybe you do cybersecurity you might
emphasize in design you might work on
databases or graphics or embedded
control systems autonomous vehicles
there's a lot of different options but
at the end of the day all these software
engineers follow the same general set of
principles in order to efficiently and
effectively
design solutions of problems with the
helpful power of computers

Hey, guys!
So, today, we're gonna be chatting
about a super interesting topic.
We're gonna be looking at
very common software engineering roles
that you'll see in the industry.
I feel like this video is gonna be really helpful
for people who are very new to the industry
and are kind of curious,
like, what is a frontend engineer?
What is a backend engineer?
Like, how do these roles interact with each other?
So, in this video,
we're gonna be talking about five common roles,
and if you're interested,
let's get started.
So, when you're enjoying a service like Netflix,
it's really easy to forget the complexity
and the effort
that it takes to build a service like this.
A service like Netflix takes the work
of thousands and thousands of software engineers,
writing millions of lines of code
to build a service
as simple and as user-friendly as Netflix.
So, one of the first roles you'll see
when you're looking at a service like Netflix
is the web developer role.
A web developer works alongside
Front End
with a UX and UI designer
to design the web interface,
which basically is the visual parts of the website
that users interact with.
Web developers are responsible for building objects
like this,
this,
and this,
as well as effects like this,
this, and this.
They're also responsible for handling
how the user will interact with certain objects
and returning the user
what exactly they should expect to get
when they interact with these objects.
Interestingly enough,
web developers are not only concerned
about the layout of their different websites
that they're building,
they're also interested in making sure
that these websites are highly performant,
which means that they're making sure
that the web page is loading very quickly.
They're managing memory.
Frontend engineers usually build their different projects
using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
But how does a web developer know exactly
what to show on the screen?
Let's say a web developer needs certain information.
Where does it go to
to get that information
so it knows what to display on the screen?
This is where the backend engineer comes in.
Back End
This is where the magic happens.
You can see the frontend as the face
and the backend is the brain.
The frontend, sort of, is responsible
for the visual parts that we all see,
but the backend engineer is responsible
for the parts of the website that you don't see.
Backend engineers are responsible
for so many different things.
They're responsible for collecting, organizing,
and returning the necessary data
that the frontend needs for the users.
They're also responsible for making sure
that the client side of this application runs smoothly.
So, you'll see backend engineers working on
a variety of different projects.
For example, in Netflix's case,
a backend engineer might be responsible
for processing payment
to know if a subscriber has paid on time.
They might also be responsible for other things
like encrypting sensitive data,
so that none of your personal information
gets leaked to the public.
You wonder how Netflix knows that
I'm watching this show currently,
it's because the frontend service is interacting
with the backend service to look at my history
to see what shows I've recently watched.
The backend engineer sends that information
to the frontend engineer
who then displays that information
so that we, the users,
can see that information.
For backend engineers,
they build their different services
using Java, Python,
and then a wide array of different technologies.
So, I'm just gonna toss another term at you,
but don't be intimidated.
This term is just a combination
of the first two roles that we've seen.
This is the role of a fullstack engineer.
Full Stack
You can see a fullstack engineer
as someone who is responsible for building out
the frontend and the backend of the service.
So, now, let's keep moving on.
So, another role that you'll see
Mobile Developers
is the mobile app developer role.
So, with Netflix,
this surface doesn't just live on netflix.com,
it's also available on the iPhone
and also on the Android.
There's a developer whose job is
to build out those different applications.
Web developers are very similar to frontend developers
in that they work with UI and UX designers
to help create the visual parts of an application.
Mobile app developers are responsible for,
of course, creating these different objects
that you'll see on an app,
as well as the different effects on the app.
And just like frontend engineers,
they're making sure to take into consideration
the performance of their different apps.
They want to make sure that different pages
are loading quickly
and they're also making sure
that nothing is crashing.
They're interacting with the backend,
just like frontend developers
to get the information
to display on the mobile application.
At Netflix, you'll see that they use languages
like Swift, Objective-C, and Java,
to build out their different mobile platforms.
And by mobile,
I'm also talking about, specifically,
iOS and Android development.
So, the next role is an extremely important role
at Netflix.
At Netflix,
DevOps/ Infra
they're not releasing their product to 12 users,
they're releasing their products
to, like, a hundred million users.
So that means that they have to make sure
that their infrastructure and developer operations
is intact.
If you're curious about what infrastructure and DevOps do,
you can see these people as responsible
for, sort of, giving users access to an application.
How does Netflix make sure that we can access
this website reliably and at a large scale?
This is where infrastructure and DevOps come in.
They're responsible for deploying these applications
so that a lot of users have access to them.
This might seem like a simple job,
but when you're a service like Netflix
and you have a hundred million users
across different countries,
it's actually extremely important
that you have very solid
and very, like, amazing infrastructure.
Netflix uses a lot of different languages
for their infrastructure in DevOps.
They use Java, they use Go,
as well as, of course, other technologies,
to build out their infrastructure in DevOps.
So, the final engineering role is, kind of,
the one that's really hot right now,
like, everyone's very interested in these types
of development jobs.
These are the roles
of machine learning engineers and data scientists.
Data Science / Machine Learning
Machine learning and data science roles
are technically very different roles.
But for the purpose of this video,
I'm gonna be grouping them into one section
because they tend to have a lot of overlapping major goals,
as well as they tend to work together
to solve these common problems.
The data scientist is someone
who works with very large, sometimes, unstructured data.
They're responsible for cleaning the data,
organizing the data,
and getting information from that data.
A machine learning engineer, on the other hand,
is responsible for implementing machine learning algorithms.
Yeah, I know.
So, like, I basically used the definition in the word.
Let me just explain what a machine learning algorithm is.
Netflix uses a bunch of different algorithms
on their service.
An example of one of their machine learning algorithms
is their recommendation algorithm.
So, how does Netflix know if you watch this show
and this show,
you'll probably want to watch this show?
It's because of their machine learning algorithms
that they built out.
Machine learning engineers are responsible
for writing out that algorithm
and making sure that that algorithm continuously learns
what you would like to watch.
This is a very complicated task
and it takes a lot of smart people working really hard
to implement these different algorithms.
It's really cool because Netflix uses machine learning
in visible aspects of their business,
as well as invisible aspects of their business.
Like I discussed before,
the recommendation algorithm is one
of the most visible place
that you'll see machine learning.
But other places where you'll see machine learning
are in deciding what thumbnails to show you as a user.
You'll also see machine learning in their search.
And then the invisible ways
you'll see machine learning at Netflix
is, sort of, creating budgets
and deciding what movies to create next,
as well as helping infrastructure teams
manage different servers
and, sort of, helping them streamline their processes.
And you'll also see machine learning and data science
in post-production and video editing.
So, it's really cool that you'll see machine learning,
not only on the visible part
as a user interacting with a website,
but also helps them with their business
on the invisible part,
like, I guess, the backend.
(keyboard clicking)
Anyways, guys,
this was a very brief overview of five different roles
that you'll see common in the industry.
I gave a very small intro to each role,
but if you're interested in learning more about each roles,
definitely look them up
and I can even make deeper videos
if you want to learn a little bit more
about what these roles do.
If you like this video,
make sure to give this video a thumbs up
and I'll see you guys next time.
Thank you for watching.

```txt
not all of us are working at these fan
companies where they've got like fancy
cafes and restaurants and they get
massages every Monday I don't know if
they do that but whenever I watch these
videos on what it's like to be a
software engineer at some of these big
companies it just seems like so
luxurious and I'm like that's not what I
experienced
[Music]
I've been thinking a lot about the
software engineer job and how I feel
like it's been kind of idealized a lot
especially in social media and so I
wanted to make this video to talk about
my experience what my day-to-day is
actually like what do I do in my job and
hopefully give you a perspective that I
think is closer to what your reality
would be like especially if you're
someone like me going to boot camp route
and working like a medium-sized company
all right so now let's just dive into
the meat of this video which is what is
it really like to be a software engineer
and specifically in my position a junior
developer a little bit about my specific
position I work for a medium-sized
company based here in Atlanta I work
nine to five Mondays through Fridays in
the summer times we get off at noon on
Fridays which is amazing I feel like
I've got great work-life balance with
this kind of 40 Hour Work Week type of
regular schedule we have flexible time
off so if I needed to take time off for
whatever reason I can do so and the
other thing I really love about this job
is that it's 100 remote so I mostly work
here in my office slash YouTube Studio
but I'm also able to go into the office
in person whenever I want to so we have
a really amazing office in downtown
Atlanta so what is it really like to be
a junior developer well in order for me
to explain like what my day-to-day is
like I think it's really important for
us to know what the product developments
life cycle is like there's different
phases of this life cycle like there's
the ideation phase where these new ideas
about what you're going to build where
you're going to produce are made and
then there's a design phase where you're
designing what that's going to look like
then there's a development phase which
is where Engineers come in and actually
build the product and then there's a
testing phase where you have
testing QA Engineers who test to make
sure that it works that nothing is
broken and then there's the deployment
phase where it gets pushed up and
deployed and becomes this real thing and
then there's the review phase where you
look back on all that you've done and
accomplished and think like what else
can we improve and then the cycle starts
all over again the reason why I wanted
to bring this up is because
what you do as a software developer fits
somewhere along this life cycle and your
job is really about development making
these technical contributions to
building the product but you don't just
do that you also have to collaborate
with the designers you're also a part of
the ideation like thinking through ideas
because early on
people want to know like is this idea
that we have even feasible can we
actually build it and that is a question
for the engineers and so there's a lot
of collaboration and there's a lot of
involvement along all of the phases of
this life cycle but for the most part
Engineers are mostly in the development
phase of things so now I'll talk a
little bit about the team structure at
my company we work on pretty large teams
so there's like seven developers on our
team we have two QA Engineers product
manager as well as an engineering
manager we have stand-ups every day
whether we meet live or we do like a
slack stand up Jack about what we're
doing but the main thing that keeps us
organized is our kanban board which is
where we've kind of broken down the
bigger projects that we're working on
into these smaller chunks which we call
tickets and we have these different
columns on our kanban board that keep
everything organized that we all know
okay what is buildable what is currently
being worked on what's being tested
what's ready for product review and
what's ready to be shipped out
and I really really like it I feel like
it's really clear what everyone is
working on and it makes it really clear
what you're working on and what needs to
be worked on so if you finish your
finish a ticket and you've shipped it
then you can like very easily just pick
up something new and you don't have to
be like hey boss like what should I work
on next like there's none of that you
can just start working on the next thing
and nobody tells you specifically what
to do you can pick up at least the way
things that work on my team you can pick
up the next task if you feel comfortable
working on it we do list our tickets by
priority so that you know you know what
is the most important thing that you
that should be worked on next but for
the most part it's not like somebody
tells you what to do you just pick up a
ticket and start working on it I guess
that is kind of daunting as a junior
developer when you first start because
you might feel like this ticket that is
probably already is huge how can I just
start working on it and it's not like
when I first started they just threw me
in they're like okay Steph just start
working on tickets a lot of the first
few months I did pair work where I would
work with someone else on a ticket and
they would kind of guide me through the
process of how to start it and you know
all the way through completion and that
was really exciting because I got to
learn like what is the process that we
do at our company okay so that kind of
gives you a broad sense of like how
things are structured and organized at
work but specifically though what does a
junior developer do I would say that the
first three to four months of my job
were really different from how they are
now like as I mentioned the first couple
of weeks on the job I was working on
these kind of baby tickets and I was
pairing on them so somebody was working
with me just to learn you know the
process of you know you know creating
the brand and how you name your branch
how you would like how you would
actually merge the pr once it's ready to
be merged after it's been qaed like the
kind of process all of these processes
and even though I was like already a
little bit familiar with Git and GitHub
because of group projects in my boot
camp it's the kind of procedures are
always different depending on where you
work and so the first couple of weeks I
just spent like getting to know those
processes as well as just learning so I
was given like I was told like just take
a couple months just to learn angular
because in my boot camp we learned react
and so I didn't really know angular yet
and so they're like yeah just here's an
ultimate angular course you can look on
udemy and just like basically self learn
it kind of felt almost like being in a
boot camp again except for it was a lot
harder because I think angular is like a
little bit more complex than react but
yeah I spent the first couple of months
just learning and
I wasn't just doing those online courses
I was doing the online courses but then
I was also taking on smaller tickets to
help me also learn this front-end
framework so I remember the first few
tickets I worked on like one of them was
just updating link paths on the front
end as well as like updating copy
another one had to do with like fixing
the functionality of one specific button
I think the very first ticket I worked
on which I paired on was just adding a
couple of files to a git ignore so they
were like these really really small
tasks that I was picking up early on and
they were really just meant for me to
have something to work on to familiarize
myself with when the processes as well
as the code base because honestly like
coming from a boot camp where you work
on these little tiny baby projects which
feel big at the time then going to a
company where you're not familiar with
the code and this is something that has
been developed over a year's time right
like over years with many many smart
people working on it it's crazy like
it's like a lot it's kind of
overwhelming and so
um I remember it would even just take me
like just for that example I gave of
like having to update a couple of links
I remembered that taking me the entire
day because I was just trying to figure
out which file I needed to even make the
update in make the changes in so
what's expected of you as a junior
developer especially in the beginning of
your first job is just becoming familiar
with the code base learning as much as
you can almost like you're still a
student asking for help when you need it
but also like recognizing that there's a
balance between you figuring stuff out
on your own learning how to Google stack
Overflow you know watch YouTube videos
and then when you're really stuck
knowing that you can ask for help and
that this is all just part of the
learning process as somebody who's just
a junior and just starting out as I said
I feel like the first three to four
months were really different from the
past three four months or so
on this job since I've been working
about seven months now and I think the
main difference is just feeling a lot
more comfortable with the processes I
feel a lot more confident picking up
like more challenging tickets now
knowing how things are structured and
how our app works and learning more
about our actual products it helps me a
lot to when I pick up tickets I feel
like it's a lot easier for me to know
like okay this is exactly what needs to
get done I'm like kind of more or less
familiar with this area of the code so I
could just start working on it there's a
lot less pre-work to figure out like
even what to do but honestly I still
have a lot of days where I pick up
tickets and I'm like I've got no idea
what I'm what I need to do and somehow I
end up figuring it out in the end and it
becomes a learning experience some
examples of things I've worked on in the
last couple of months include creating a
flipper flag for like a new feature I
worked on a couple of spikes and spikes
are basically when you do research to
figure out how something works I worked
on one that was trying to figure out
this API and how it worked but yeah I
would say that on most of my day so
going back to this day-to-day what is
the job like on the day-to-day
um we're picking up tickets there's a
lot of time spent coding by myself but
also you know we pay on things like
collaborate with one of my teammates
um but we also have meetings so we meet
once a week as a whole team we go over
our board and we call these refinements
where we're kind of refining our work
and talking about it and
if there's issues it's a really good
time to bring those up aside from these
team meetings and coding we also at my
company have guilds which are kind of
like clubs so we have one for a front
end we have one for backend they're
really just a space for you to learn
from like senior developers who will
bring in ideas or bring in like new
Frameworks or things like that or even
just to just discuss issues that have
come up in in our app and it's really
just kind of like a free space to like
raise anything that you want to talk
about as you would kind of like in a
club meeting and aside from guilds we
also have ergs which are employee
resource groups in January I actually
became one of the leaders for ndrgmi
company called aapi which is Asian
American Pacific Islander and basically
we have meetings where we plan events we
plan kind of different kinds of
engagements with our community and the
whole purpose is really to build
community Unity within the company
another thing I wanted to bring up is I
have some friends who are not developers
not software Engineers who have said
things along the lines of like oh it
must be nice to just like work from home
and like kind of implying that this job
is kind of easy and like chill which it
is pretty chill but it's definitely not
an easy job I think it comes with a
whole list of challenges and luckily I
love being challenged and so it fits
really nicely with like what I seek in a
type of career but I would say it's not
a job that's for everyone and that's
kind of the point of this video that if
you're kind of drawn to this career
because of like the lifestyle that is
really attractive and intriguing but you
haven't thought much about like what is
the job itself
I just want you to think about that a
little bit more because
it's super challenging like you pick up
things to pick up tickets and maybe not
understand what you need to do or get
frustrated because your code doesn't
work and you're the one that needs to
figure it out and I think it really the
job requires you to be really passionate
about problem solving you need to really
enjoy technical challenges which I do
like I love being stuck on something and
like you know you can't put it down
because you just have to figure it out
like there's been times where I've
literally not for work because I try to
have work-life balance but on personal
projects personal coding projects where
I've stayed up till four in the morning
because I literally am just like why
doesn't this work I try not to bring
that like energy into work because I
want to have boundaries and everything
but I still think that
to for this job to work for you in the
long term you have to be have that kind
of personality or drive or passion to
like like solving problems
and specifically like solving technical
problems I also think it's challenging
because this job requires you to do a
lot of self-learning so like I said
before it's a lot of research it's a lot
of reading documentation figuring things
out on your own and that can be really
stressful at times and if you're up for
the challenge then you're definitely
going to love this field and love this
job
but I don't think it's for everyone and
I think that's totally okay and yeah I
really hope that this video was helpful
for you to give you a sense of what it's
like to be a software engineer and
specifically a junior developer in case
that is the career transitioning career
path that you're interested in and I
hope that this was a more realistic
sense of what this job is like compared
to Lifestyle videos and what you see on
Tick Tock and other spaces in social
media don't forget to like this video if

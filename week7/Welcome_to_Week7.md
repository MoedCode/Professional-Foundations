Intro to Week 7
Welcome to Week 7 learners!
The most happening and exciting week of Month 2!

This week is all about applying that creativity and innovation you learnt and heard so much about last week. So get ready to unleash your creativity and tap into your innovative side. Did you know that creativity comes from a different part of your brain than logic? Well, itâ€™s time to exercise that creative muscle, geek out and set your imagination free!

Together with your amazing team, youâ€™ll work towards the common goal you set up last week, and create the wireframes and prototypes. To get a clear understanding of whatâ€™s expected this week and to get those creative juices flowing, be sure to check out our Week 7 overview video. It will provide you with valuable insights and set the stage for an incredible week ahead.


Collaborative innovation here we come!

#  Week 7 Overview - Transcript


Hello everyone! Muhammmad Khisal Ahmed here, welcoming you to Week 7! Can you believe how fast time is moving? After this week you will only have one more week to complete the program!
As you start Week 7 and get ready for your next team meeting, we want to remind you that it's common for teams to encounter challenges and frustrations while working together. We want you to know we acknowledge and care about your frustrations, and we donâ€™t expect any team to pull off miracles. We just ask you to do your best. I want to encourage you to stay positive and invite you to give your best effort, even in the face of challenging circumstances.
Part of the reason we focus a big chunk of ALX Foundations around working in teams is because we know being an outstanding teammate is one of the most valuable skills to have for career longevity and advancement. In most tech jobs, you will be working as part of a larger team. We want you to gain real-life experiences with the challenges and benefits of working in a team.
We also value your reflections on the team process. Whether your team is humming along or experiencing a lot of challenges, we encourage you to think deeply about whatâ€™s working and how you could make it work even better.
This week, Week 7, you will continue to build on your teamâ€™s progress.
Specifically, the focus of your team efforts this week will be on creating your wireframes or 3D prototype, which serves as an initial design of your solution. Weâ€™ll walk you through each step so you can gain confidence as you learn about how to do this. Your team will also be creating a pitch presentation that showcases your work through a coherent story of problem solving and effective solutions.
The content for Week 7 centres around setting you up to successfully complete your wireframes or prototypes, and to successfully create your pitch presentation. You will also be learning some additional skills to apply the different elements of user-centred design, how to overcome imposter syndrome, and further exploration of the different career opportunities available to you in tech, specifically in your chosen tech track, if youâ€™re part of the tech lite program.
You will have 4 activities this week: the first is a short online discussion where your team will decide what type of solution youâ€™re building. This means choosing whether youâ€™re creating a 3D prototype or a wireframe using the checklists provided. In this meeting you should also discuss the initial plan for your pitch presentation. The second is an individual activity where you will design your own prototypes or wireframes in preparation for your second meeting. You will also individually prepare a basic draft presentation for your team solution pitch. The third is a team meeting where you will finalize one prototype or wireframe as a team, and then work on your solutionsâ€™ pitch presentation. This is where your individual activities will help drive things along. The final activity is a peer reflection exercise where you will reflect on your tech tracks and what youâ€™ve learnt about them.
As usual, you have two submissions due in Week 7.
Week 7 Test is an auto-graded quiz. The list of topics covered appears on the next few pages here on Savanna.
Week 7 Milestone will be a showcase of your teamâ€™s wireframes or prototype, your teamâ€™s pitch presentation slides, and a reflection on the process and health of your team.
Remember, you and each of your teammates must submit your own Week 7 Milestone. Some elements of the milestone will be the same for the team - for example, the teamâ€™s prototype of wireframe, and the pitch presentation - but other elements will be unique to you. Weâ€™ve provided clear instructions on the Week 7 Milestone page. Please review everything carefully.
It is another packed week, and you'll need to plan ahead so you can get the most out of it. Coordinate with your team early and communicate with them often.
We hope this is a great week and that you enjoy the process of starting to bring your solutions to life. We wish you all the best with Week 7.

# Week #7 Milestone & Test


Donâ€™t worry, you will have more than 5 minutes to finish your test and milestone! ðŸ˜‰

Week #7 Milestone
Week #7 Milestone is a submission of your/your teamâ€™s wireframes or 3D prototype, a reflection on how things are going with your team, and a presentation pitching your project solution.

As usual, every team member must submit their own milestone, but some portions of the work can be shared (specifically, creating the wireframes / 3D prototypes and creating the pitch video).

Your Week #7 Milestone submission will be a Google doc (that you convert to pdf) that includes:

If your team is creating Wireframes:

Images of each screen (or page) of your wireframes, including indications of navigation functionality, elements, and annotation. You should have at least 6 images. Detailed instructions on how to do this are found in this weekâ€™s content here on Canvas.
Optional: a 60-second (or less) video similar to this one. (Upload the video to YouTube and provide a link in your submission.)
Answer the additional questions asked in the Week #7 Milestone prompt.
If your team is creating a 3D Prototype:

Create a video lasting no more than 60 seconds, that shows your prototype in action. Detailed instructions on how to create your 3D prototype are found in this weekâ€™s content here on Canvas.
The video should provide a full 360-degree view of your prototype and at least 1 function that it has.
Upload the video to YouTube and provide a link in your Google Doc.
Answer the additional questions asked in the Week #7 Milestone prompt.
The above info is just to help you envision whatâ€™s coming. Please make sure that you go through all the Week 7 content here on Savanna, before attempting your Week #7 Milestone.

# Daily 3 Check-In


via GIPHY

We have spoken about the Daily 3 so many times so by now you probably can predict what we are about to say next.

Yes, the message will be the same and that’s the point - to keep encouraging you to commit to the Daily 3.  Building beneficial habits is an investment in yourself that no one can ever take away. You will reap the benefits now and in the long term. Most highly successful people practice at least 1 of the Daily 3 on a regular basis! So give yourself the gift of continuing to commit to these practices.

We invite you to take a moment to reflect:

Which of the Daily 3 has been the most consistent for you? Which has been the hardest?

How is it going if you partnered with peers to complete Daily 3? If not, what is preventing you from finding a peer?

Doing the Daily 3 is its own reward, but are there additional rewards you can give yourself if you meet your goals?

Can you think of 1 creative way to boost or sustain your motivation to practice the Daily 3 this week?

You have the leeway to personalize the Daily 3 with alternative beneficial activities that are exciting to you. If you choose this option, what activities or practices will you incorporate into your daily routine to stay active, clear-minded, and centred?

# Reflection: Daily 3 Impact
We want to check in and ask how you are doing with your Daily 3 activities, and how much they have impacted your daily life!

Don’t worry, this survey is not graded - we just want to better understand where you are, and to also help you be as accountable to yourself as possible!

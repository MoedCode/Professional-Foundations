# Why We Share Stories

![alt text](image-2.png)
Storytelling is a powerful tool that plays an essential role in the workplace. Stories can help to convey complex information in a simple and relatable way, allowing stakeholders to better understand and connect with new ideas and concepts. Sharing progress updates, success stories, and demonstrating growth potential can inspire and motivate.

Additionally, storytelling can help to create a sense of community and foster relationships among colleagues, helping to build a positive and productive work environment. By incorporating storytelling into their communication strategies, organizations can better engage employees and clients, promote collaboration and creativity, and ultimately achieve greater success.

In this module, we will explore writing as a form of storytelling. In subsequent modules, we will explore other forms of telling compelling stories.

But first, before we start, we are curious to know…

What is your story?
In a few sentences, share an exciting short story about yourself on the Portal, that you would like your peers to know.
# Storytelling Rubric
When we listen to stories as audience members, we unknowingly respond and make judgments in our head about whether the story resonates or “clicks” with us and how the speaker does this. Below are a few of the characteristics we typically watch out for in the stories we hear and what effective storytellers can do.


| **Characteristic** | **Description** |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| **AUDIENCE RELEVANCE** | The speaker can use their understanding of a specific audience to decide what content is most relevant to and effective for them. Content addresses a specific audience and successfully provides relevant and effective information for the specific audience. |
| **LANGUAGE** | The speaker has a solid understanding of language usage that they apply to create authentic content that has an appropriate register (vocabulary, voice, tone, sentence structure, and terminology), clarity and accurate, varied language. The language is inviting and effective, with high accuracy in grammar, vocabulary, and a variety of sentence structures; register and style are effective and appropriate for the task. |
| **VOICE** | The speaker can create a consistent and engaging voice which is appropriate to the medium they are using. The text is free of clichés, generalizations, or technical jargon. The story sounds fresh and different (offers a different perspective). |
| **NARRATIVES** | The speaker understands the qualities of effective storytelling and uses them to create powerful narratives that engage an audience and inspire action. The story provides vivid scenes that center around a relatable protagonist. It also contains all the elements of effective narrative storytelling (characters, dialogue, engages the audience, and avoids the inverted pyramid). The story is written mostly in real-time, has a balance of detail and summary, and is free of the “Most Common Storytelling Mistakes.” |
| **STRUCTURING** | The speaker can structure a story effectively to create maximum impact on an audience. The story of self has a clear purpose/problem identified in the beginning and is rooted in personal experiences. The story has a clear and engaging call to action. |


Finding the right combination of the elements above in your storytelling can convert you into a powerful speaker!

# Storytelling Example 1

Audience Relevance
Language
Voice
Narratives
Structuring
Video # 1: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie
The danger of a single story: What is the power of a story, especially when only one side gets to tell it? That is what Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a Nigerian novelist, argues in her TED Talk. She shares that a single story about a person or place can be dangerous. She gives an example of her experience of reading books with characters that didn’t look like her and her discovery of African literature that showed her different stories. Let’s watch the video to see how she uses an amazing narrative to explain the power of storytelling.

# Storytelling Example 2
Video # 2: Danai Gurira
Danai Gurira offers her brief but spectacular take on growing up in Zimbabwe and telling African stories on American soil. We saw this and were completely inspired by how she saw a problem with the way African women’s stories are told and did something about it.

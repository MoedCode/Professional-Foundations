# Week #4 Test: Are you Ready?


For Week #4 Test, you will need to demonstrate the knowledge gained from Week #4 Milestone activities, including:

Problem Solving
Work Planning Principles and Best Practices
The Writing Process and Best Practices
Goal setting
Storytelling - including the creation of target audience, personas, and identifying key messages.
You should have studied each topic, completed all activities, all ‚ÄúCheck Your Understanding‚Äù quizzes and Milestone before attempting to take the test. You must get a 70% to pass. When you are ready to take your Week #4 Test, please proceed.

# Week #4 Milestone Readiness
You‚Äôve made it! And it‚Äôs that time for your weekly milestone. Here is a quick sneak peek.
For Week #4 Milestone you will use skills that you acquired in Weeks 3 and 4 to prepare a Google Slides presentation. You will be asked to create slides with:

Your chosen GCGO/Problem Statement and Why it matters (Use the 3 types of persuasion (Pathos, Logos, Ethos) to build a case of why its important to solve the problem.)

Its impact on a specific target audience (#UserPersonas)

The person you need to be to solve this problem or achieve this mission

Your goals

We‚Äôll take you through it step by step.

Ready? Come on, you can do this. And if you believe us you can listen to Oprah.

# Week #4 Milestone
Important Note

As mentioned before, Week #4 Milestone builds onto all the work you did as part of your Week #3 Milestone, last week. You will refer back to your chosen GCGO and identified problem, your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù for selecting it, the questions you asked, and the web research you completed.


Note: You do have the option to choose a different GCGO and/or problem from the ones you used in Week 3 BUT we recommend against this because you would need to re-do all the Week #3 Milestone activities again with your new GCGO or/and problem before coming back to Week #4 Milestone. If you decide to use a different GCGO/ problem for Week #4 Milestone, you will need to redo all the Week 3 problem scoping, questioning, and research work but make sure that you DO NOT resubmit your Week #3 Milestone (nor Week #3 Test).



Considering the time limitation and amount of work involved, we strongly recommend that you work with the same GCGO and problem that you used for your Week #3 Milestone.



Week #4 Milestone requires you to put your Week 3 and Week 4 learnings into action by creating a compelling slide presentation.

IMPORTANT: Please read through all of the instructions here before you begin. If you have gone systematically through all of the learning content this week, then it should be straightforward to complete your presentation.



Instructions

Step 1: Audience Identification

First, identify who your audience for the presentation is. You should choose your target audience because you expect that they could help you work on your problem in some way. It can be narrow or broad. For example, ‚ÄúCEOs of the top 500 companies in the world,‚Äù ‚ÄúGirls ages 16-18 throughout Rwanda.‚Äù ‚ÄúAdults with full-time jobs in tech between the ages of 35-45 in Kenya and Tanzania.‚Äù (For now, you can just write down who your target audience is and in what way you imagine they might help you on a piece of paper or in a Google doc. You will later include this information as an appendix in your slide deck.)



Step 2: Create a User Persona

Next, create an example user persona from this identified target audience. (For now, you may simply write this down on a piece of paper or in a Google Doc, but you will later include this information as an appendix in your slide deck.)

Remember that this is not a real individual but rather an example. You should include:

Their name (this made up)
Gender
Age
Profession
Education History
Annual income
Access to technology
Any other relevant information.
You could even find‚Äì or AI generate‚Äì an image of this person.

Keep this persona in mind as you create your slide deck. Imagine that they will be sitting in your audience as you give your presentation.



Step 3: Create Your Slide Deck

Open a new presentation template in Google Slides, or create a new deck using one of the many AI-supported apps for slide creation. We encourage you to experiment and learn about what tools you like. You have our full permission to explore and experience the innovative power of AI. The examples listed here - and many others - have free versions that you can use:

https://www.beautiful.ai/

https://simplified.com/ai-presentation-maker



Your slide deck should contain the following:

Slide 1:

State your problem in 1 sentence. Your problem should be a sub-component of a GCGO. (As stated above, we recommend you use the same problem/GCGO as last week, but you can change it if you wish to re-do the steps in Week #3 Milestone.)

For example, if your GCGO was climate change your problem might be ‚ÄúPlastic pollution in the city of Nairobi is growing.‚Äù If your GCGO was healthcare your GCGO might be ‚ÄúThere is a huge shortage of physicians in Namibia,‚Äù and if your GCGO was arts, culture, and design your problem might be ‚ÄúVisual artists across the African continent lack a platform to sell their work.‚Äù (We also recommend that you use the same problem that you scoped and researched last week, but you can change it if you wish.)

Then briefly describe WHY your problem matters in 1-2 sentences. Challenge yourself to state your WHY as clearly and succinctly as possible.



Slide 2:

Make it personal. Describe 1 person or 1 specific group of people impacted by this problem and how it impacts them.



Slides 3-5:

On each of these slides, present 1 piece of factual information that your web research revealed about your problem (from Week #3 Milestone). If you are presenting numerical data, consider including a graph or other data visualization. Cite the (reliable) source as a footnote at the bottom on each page. You should select information to share that is compelling, relevant, and accurate.



Slide 6:

Use your work from the Goal Setting Worksheet to define the kind of person needed to solve this problem. You can break this down into the 4 elements described in the Worksheet or make this definition holistic. It‚Äôs up to you! üôÇ



Slides 7-10:

For each of these slides, share your 20 year, 10 year, 5 year and 1 year goals, as you have defined them in your Goal Setting Worksheet. Be sure that each of your goals are ‚ÄúSMART‚Äù- Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.



Other Guidelines

Minimize the amount of text on each slide. Keep only what is absolutely necessary.
Use a minimum font size of 18.
At least 6 of the slides should have an image. Be sure to credit the source.
Choose a background color that is professional and non-distracting.
Make sure the text is clearly readable against the background color.
Proofread your work to make sure it is free of typos and grammatical errors.
We strongly recommend you ask a peer to review your presentation and offer to review theirs before submitting.


Step 4: Export, Rename, and Submit.

Export/print/convert your slide deck as a .pdf.

Rename the .pdf using the following naming convention Milestone04_First Name_Surname_DD.MM.YYYY

For example, a correct file name is: ‚ÄúMilestone04_Mercy_Akuru-Simon_06.07.2024.pdf‚Äù.

Submit the .pdf on Savanna

We are only giving you a sense of what we are looking for. Use your own original ideas for an impactful presentation deck. Aim to design a deck that tops ours.

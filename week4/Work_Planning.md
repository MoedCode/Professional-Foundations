# Looking Ahead to Month 2

![alt text](image-25.png)
Now that you have your goals defined, you will have clearer idea of what you want to achieve over the next month of this program. Month 2 will be all about collaboration with your peers as part of a project team and you will need to manage your time and commitments carefully. There is a substantial amount of content to cover and multiple activities to complete alone and with peers. Here‚Äôs a sneak peek of what to expect:

Month 2

We will pay much more attention to how solutions are developed. Your team will decide upon 1 single problem that you will be focused on developing a solution for. You‚Äôll conduct some additional research on this problem and also create visualizations of data that illustrate the problem, its impact, and its projected trend.

Your team will then brainstorm and ideate to decide on a viable possible solution (or a way to lessen the impact of your problem) that leverages technology. Together, you will work to create wireframes or a 3D prototype of your proposed solution. Lastly, you‚Äôll create a video showcasing your work and make a pitch for your proposed next steps of development.

This whole process is broken down as follows:

Week 5:

Your team will decide on a single problem statement, conduct research, and provide evidence of its impact and trends (using data and visualizations).

Week 6:

Your team will brainstorm possible solutions, including using the ‚Äúbad idea brainstorm‚Äù technique. You will then decide on a single problem statement and idea for a proposed solution (that uses technology) and use that to create a basic wireframe or prototype of the solution that you‚Äôre proposing.

Week 7:

Your team will conduct at least 2 user interviews to improve on your initial ideas. Your team will make final tweaks to the prototype or wireframe. Your team will create a video that showcases your proposed solution, and how it would work, and make a pitch for how you would further develop and test it, and what would happen if it were successful.

Week 8:

Week 8 is all about your career! In this week you‚Äôll go through the ins and outs of how to present yourself to an employer, how to write great resumes, set up great LinkedIn profiles and write excellent cover letters. You will also get some advice on how to ace your interviews!

This is just a high-level overview so you know where you‚Äôre going! We also shared an overview in Week 1:
```md
# Program Overview
![alt text](image-23.png)

We have created a program summary so you have an overview of what the next 2 months will entail. If you would like to scan through it you can go through the slides below. You can also download it here and keep a copy for yourself if you want.

The overview covers the key skills you will master in the first 2 months. It is a clear guide on what you will learn but please note that the flow of modules and content might move around as the week progresses. This will be to keep the content relevant and applicable to each week‚Äôs key takeaways.

Exciting times are ahead and we hope that seeing this overview will help you proactively plan ahead.
```
, that outlines what Month 2 will entail.

Given the importance of managing your time and resources effectively, now is an appropriate moment to introduce the concept of a Work Plan, also known as a Project Plan or Gantt Chart.

Let‚Äôs delve deeper into this exciting topic and wrap up Month 1 with a clear game plan of how to plan your successful participation and completion of Month 2.

# Intro to Work Planning


Any activity that requires several steps can be called a project.

Some projects, like building a 70-story building in the middle of Addis, require a lot of resources, time and skilled people. Others, like building a motherboard for a personal computer, may only call for a few specific resources and 1 - 2 pairs of hands.  In each case, specified actions must be carried out, sometimes by different people and in a particular order, to accomplish the primary objective.

Your Month 2 collaboration, will require several steps to be complete and can be rightfully called a project. Now that you know you have Month 2 around the corner, you will need to at least plan out your next 5 weeks to ensure you can complete all aspects of the team project collaborations! Think about ways you can create more time for yourself in Month 2. What can you do and when? What can you delegate? What do you need for your Month 2 to be structured for success ?

Embarking on any project necessitates a well-crafted plan that outlines the tasks and activities essential for achieving your project‚Äôs goals. This is where a work plan comes in handy. A work plan is a meticulous blueprint, mapping out the tasks, timelines, allocated resources, and responsibilities required to bring your project to fruition. It serves as a compass for project managers, enabling them to track progress, manage resources efficiently, and navigate potential obstacles.

We know that you are curious to see what a simple work plan looks like. Here is an example of one that we created. No need to start completing it now. We will come back to creating your own work plan at the end of the module.

Since we are already talking about work plans, let‚Äôs take a quick detour and explore other key Project Management considerations through a professional (workspace) lens. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll quickly absorb this valuable knowledge and then dash back to crafting your personalized work plan for the next few weeks.

question mark
Think about it:

Planning action steps for your Month 2 is a great way to learn how to use this process to create an actual action plan for what you‚Äôre trying to do!
It isn‚Äôt limited to Month 2 only though. Remember the goals you determined for yourself in the previous module? You can run the same process to make sure you have an action plan for how to complete those goals.

| Category | Action Item/Deliverables | Owner | Resources | Start Date | End Date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Milestone | Submit Milestone 3 | Me | Savanna | 24-Feb-24 | 9-Mar-24 | Not started |
| Milestones | Catch up on all missing milestones | Me | Laptop | 26-Feb-24 | 15-Feb-24 | Behind |

# Project Scope
In the project management process, project scoping typically comes before work planning, so let‚Äôs talk about that next.

Project scope is a crucial component of project planning as it involves determining a list of specific project goals, deliverables, tasks, costs and deadlines.

It outlines the project‚Äôs boundaries to help the project owner/team remain focused on the task at hand and procedures for how completed work will be verified and approved.
A project‚Äôs scope also describes the project‚Äôs purpose, what is included and isn‚Äôt, and important processes, assumptions, and limits.
A scope is sometimes referred to as a statement of work (SOW), or terms of reference (ToR).
Take a moment to watch this video that breaks down a Project Scope Statement from a professional perspective. As you watch note check your understanding with these guiding questions:

What are the elements that need to be included in a project scope statement?
What does each element entail?

To recap, an effective project scope statement will include the following elements:
Project justification - you should have this from your problem statement and questioning exercises
Product scope - what is meant to be covered in the project
Acceptance criteria - how to check that it‚Äôs going well
Deliverables- exact milestones to be achieved
Exclusions- what is NOT involved in the project
Constraints- blockers to success
Assumptions- what you assume is true

in this video you are going to learn
what a project scope statement is and
how to use it in project management also
I will show you an example hello and me
to the film project management basics
and I help people just like you to
become a project manager if you want to
become a PM you are in the right place
subscribe to this channel right now
before we talk about project scope stay
tuned
let's review its place in project
management framework
we do need some inputs before you can
start drafting it out it all starts with
a project charter this document contains
high-level information about the project
and its boundary it might be as simple
as a web application for our corporate
clients or one-story house with a garage
then we'll find the relevant project
stakeholders who have expertise and
authority to provide specific
requirements first your clients provide
the main requirements then you collect
relevant requirements from your team and
subject matter experts within your
organization together you work to find
detailed requirements if needed to
create a requirements traceability metal
okay just to be sure we're on the same
side let's clarify the difference
between the scope of work and the
requirements a requirement is a
Scope of Work vs Requirements
condition or capability that is required
to be present in a product service or
result to satisfy a contractor formally
import specifications and a project
scope is the work performed to deliver a
product service or result with the
specified features and functionality
described in a contract or are the
formal impulse specification so what
does it mean a requirement is what a
product should look like what should it
be capable of what are the
characteristics behavior performance and
so on while project scope describes what
work should be performed to meet all
those requirements so only once you know
the main requirements you can outline
the project scope that's where you start
drafting the project scope statement
project scope statement is
the description of a product and project
scope it is used as a written
confirmation of what your project is
going to produce and how what's the key
to useful projects scope statement I
believe you need to use terms and
language that any stakeholder
understands these piece of projects cool
Breslin is mainly for your customers and
clients what should be included
justification of a project project scope
acceptance criteria deliverables
projects exclusions constraints and
assumptions okay if you watched until
this moment leave me eight years in the
comments below because now we are going
into the main part of this video I will
explain how to create a project scope
statement on an example of a simple
project let's imagine I work in a web
development studio and I need to create
a project management basic site as it
looks now let's do it justification of
the project it is a short description of
business need sometimes one sentence is
enough the rest should stay in the
project chart in our case as a project
management blogger I need a platform to
host my articles on project management
and build audience of loyal readers it
is a cornerstone of my business product
Product Scope
scope here you put description of all
the characteristics traits and
functionality of a product or service
that you need to produce keep in mind
that you collected requirements from
different stakeholders do not assume
that all of them communicate with each
other so it is the primary place to
align the expectations of all key
stakeholders you need to show the amount
and complexity of work required to meet
different requirements put the most of
your efforts in this section in our
example we need to deliver a website
based on WordPress it's the platform
that have all the internet uses with
minimum custom software development the
site means the home page blogger curve
and article template as it was designed
and a special forum to collect emails
again keep in mind that by this moment
we need to have memory
already specified acceptance criteria
Acceptance Criteria
these are the conditions that must be
met before the project deliverables are
accepted you can include an acceptable
level and the number of defects here as
well we agreed that this is delivered
when I can access PM basics one on one
dot-com site on the internet and seal
the main deliverables
there should be no defects that prevent
using the main functionality or doesn't
have a simple workaround visually and
functionally the site should look and
perform as described in specifications
and designs currently provide a sign off
on the final results we are not writing
a contract here it's an agreement it
should be readable and easy to
understand don't try to cover your back
here you can do it by providing a
realistic project management plan late
deliverables it is the description of
Late Deliverables
all deliverables your project will
produce it may include the project or
service project documentation product
menus educational materials for your
product and so on so put all tangible
and intangible results that you need to
hand off to the client at the end of
your project so in our example the
client wants to get some project
management deliverables like water
breakdown structure and project schedule
and product deliverables first home page
with text images and form to collect
emails second blog archive at least 10
recent articles with sidebar thought
blog post template so that all articles
have the same feel in book all I need to
do is to fill it with content text and
images for example I also want to have
this little form at the end of each
article project exclusions here you need
Project exclusions
to specify what is out of the project
scope quite often a part of stakeholders
want something specific the other part
of stakeholders or customers does not
support it so it's a config situation
but once the conflict is resolved and it
was decided to remove this part of scope
from the pro
you put it here in the project
exclusions it says time in the future
firstly you will not have to revisit
this project exclusions again but
stakeholders may try to include them
later during the project execution
however unless something dramatically
changes you should not waste time on the
reviewing exclusion secondly unless it's
clearly stated someone may still expect
you will deliver this part of scope
don't feed false expectations it will be
easier to handle the project at the end
in our example website will be created
on WordPress so custom software
development is beyond this project
students only area for the perfect
junior project manager program is out of
the scope of current project we need
these exclusions to ensure that even if
we have time and money we don't drift
away from reaching our main objective to
deliver website with the blog
constraints anything that limits you to
Blog constraints
deliver the product efficiently should
be stated here so from project charter
we have project budget constraint which
is $1500 there is a deadline on August
25 in the way constrained by technology
options we can only use WordPress please
notice that this constraint might not be
mentioned in the project charter early
at the project beginning assumptions
Assumptions
these are the uncertainties that
couldn't be clarified at this moment you
may need to accept some of them during
planning in case an assumption proves to
be invalid you have a right to modify
the project plan so in our case our
assumption is that it's possible to
deliver a project using standard
WordPress capabilities also we should
assume that this form will integrate
with WordPress seamlessly okay here is
an important aspect a customer a client
should approve the project scope
statement in fact it's a 4:1 and mutual
agreement it states that you are
committed to delivering described
results and
they identified assumptions and with
being clear constraints on the other
hand customers agreed to accept these
specify the results but what's more
important you will continue planning
project based on the information
approved in the project's cost statement
you will break down major deliverables
to identify 100% of scope
it means you estimate cost and duration
only all the tasks required to produce
these deliverables it doesn't mean that
we cannot change the project scope no it
means that to mallika change we need to
amend the agreement however well there
is a change request from customers
during project execution and it's not
described in the initial project scope
statement it's a valid reason for you to
make adjustment to project budget
schedule and other parts of project
management plan that's why it's so
important to read project scope
statement using tools and language that
your clients understand it's a mutually
beneficial document that prevents
conflicts in the future how do you use
project scope statement without ideally
you simply take the main deliverables
and put them on the first level of
decomposition into the work breakdown
structure then you decompose them
further until you get to the level
suitable for estimation also you can use
assumptions and constraints from here as
initial input to their risk management
activities okay if you liked this video
and it's time for you to become a
project manager subscribe to this
channel also do check additional
resources in the description below but
before we go let me ask you a question
what do you think is the biggest benefit
of the projects called statement is it
understanding all the projects scope by
customer or your ability to refer to the
scope statement when a change request
comes leave me a comment below thank you
in advance
[Music]

# Scope Creep
Have you ever come up with a great plan, but when you were executing it, you kept adding (or removing) aspects of it and then ended up with a different plan altogether? It is almost like planning to go to the store to buy food for tomorrow, then on your way, you remember that you need to pass by a friend‚Äôs. You decide to change your original plan and pass by your friend‚Äôs but never end up making it to the store.

In project management, we call this Scope Creep. Every project should start with a set of agreed-upon project requirements, but scope creep occurs when those needs are increased without permission or other safeguards. Scope creep ‚Äì also known as feature creep, focus creep, creeping functionality and kitchen-sink syndrome ‚Äì can sneak up and destroy a project.

In any project, there tends to be a gap between what was planned and what actually happened. The addition of new objectives, deliverables or tasks during the life of a project is known as scope creep because it essentially grows your scope steadily until you have more on your plate than you can handle.

Take a moment to study [this article that shares insight on Managing Scope Creep In Project Management](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/-OI1yzdfA6eMDKS-DM012Q)

Managing Scope Creep in Project Management

Last Updated March 8, 2024

Project managers have been plagued by scope creep since the dawn of project management. Managing scope creep in project management is a challenging job that needs clearly defined, documented and controlled specifications.

Scope creep ‚Äì also known as feature creep, focus creep, creeping functionality and kitchen-sink syndrome ‚Äì can sneak up, morph and destroy a project.

Project Scope Defined
What does ‚Äúproject scope‚Äù mean? Simply put, it is a project‚Äôs parameters. The project scope should be identified in a detailed description identifying and describing all major deliverables and any project boundaries.

It needs to include sufficient information for the project team to produce the desired product on time and within budget. In general, the project scope is determined early in the project management processes, documented and agreed upon by all project stakeholders.

How Does Scope Creep Happen?
Even when there‚Äôs a clearly defined project scope, you still have to beware of scope creep. This phenomenon generally tends to occur when new features are added to product designs that have already been approved, without providing equivalent increases in budget, time and/or resources. Project Smart, based in the United Kingdom, finds the main causes of scope creep are:

Poor Requirements Analysis: Customers don‚Äôt always know what they want and can only provide a vague idea. The ‚ÄúI‚Äôll know it when I see it‚Äù syndrome.
Not Involving the Users Early Enough: Thinking you know what the users want or need is a serious mistake. It is important to involve them in both the requirements analysis and design phases.
Underestimating the Complexity of the Project: Many projects run into problems because they are new in an industry and have never been done before. Nobody knows what to expect, there are no lessons learned and no one to ask.
Lack of Change Control: You can expect there to be a degree of scope creep in most projects, therefore it is important to design a process to manage these changes. A simple process of document, consider, approve and resource can be implemented.
Gold Plating: This term is given to the practice of exceeding the scope of a project in the belief that a value is being added. These changes inevitably consume time and budget and are not guaranteed to increase customer satisfaction.
More Reasons for Scope Creep
It‚Äôs no secret that managing scope creep in project management can be a daunting challenge. Since the project scope is often fluid in nature, it tends to morph as the project progresses. However, it can easily become disastrous if it‚Äôs allowed to get out of control. For example, Wikipedia lists the following causes of scope creep:

Disingenuous customer with a determined ‚Äúvalue for free‚Äù policy
Poor communication between parties
Lack of proper initial identification of what is required to bring about the project objectives
Poor change control
Weak project manager or executive sponsor
Agile software development based on subjective quantifications
Startling Project Statistics
Although scope creep is not the only nemesis a project can have, it does tend to have the farthest reach. Without a properly defined project and/or allowing numerous changes along the way, a project can easily go over budget, miss the deadline and wreak havoc on project success. Not surprisingly, less than a third of projects are completed on time and within budget. The Standish Group‚Äôs CHAOS Summary 2009 found that:

32% of all projects were successful, meaning delivered on time, on budget, with required features and functions
44% were challenged; these projects were late, over budget, and/or with less than the required features and functions
24% failed which was denoted by those projects that were canceled prior to completion or delivered and never used
‚ÄúThese numbers represent a downtick in the success rates of the previous study, as well as a significant increase in the number of failures,‚Äù says Jim Crear, Standish Group CIO. ‚ÄúThey are the low point in the last five study periods. This year‚Äôs results represent the highest failure rate in over a decade.‚Äù

How to Control Scope Creep
Managing scope creep in project management is achievable. A recent article on Tech Republic, a CBS Interactive website, provides the following guidelines to set yourself up to successfully control the scope of your project:

Be sure you thoroughly understand the project vision. Meet with the project drivers and deliver an overview of the project as a whole for their review and comments.
Understand your priorities and the priorities of the project drivers. Make an ordered list that you can refer to throughout the project duration. Items should include budget, deadline, feature delivery, customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction. You‚Äôll use this list to justify your scheduling decisions once the project has commenced.
Define your deliverables and have them approved by the project drivers. Deliverables should be general descriptions of functionality to be outlined during the project.
Break the approved deliverables into actual work requirements. The requirements should be as detailed as necessary and can be completed using a simple spreadsheet. The larger your project, the more detail you should include. If your project spans more than a month or two, don‚Äôt forget to include time for software upgrades during development and always include time for ample documentation.
Break the project down into major and minor milestones and complete a generous project schedule to be approved by the project drivers. Minor milestones should not span more than a month. Whatever your method for determining task duration, leave room for error. When working with an unknown staff, I generally schedule 140% to 160% of the duration as expected to be delivered. If your schedule is tight, reevaluate your deliverables. Coming in under budget and ahead of schedule leaves room for additional enhancements.
Once a schedule has been created, assign resources and determine your critical path using a project evaluation and review technique (PERT) chart or work breakdown structure. Your critical path will change over the course of your project, so it‚Äôs important to evaluate it before development begins. Follow this map to determine which deliverables must be completed on time. In very large projects, try not to define phase specifics too early, but even a general plan will give you the backbone you need for successful delivery.
Expect that there will be scope creep. Implement change order forms early and educate the project drivers on your processes. A change order form will allow you to perform a cost-benefit analysis before scheduling changes requested by the project drivers.
If you can perform all of these steps immediately, you‚Äôll be better positioned for project success. However, any steps you‚Äôre able to implement will bring you that much closer to avoiding and controlling scope creep. That way, you are in a better position to control your project, instead of your project controlling you.

One of the most insidious problems project managers face is scope creep. Scoping is hard - perhaps the hardest discipline within project management. So knowing how to prevent scope creep will be critical to protecting all of your hard work.

You need to lock in your project scope as early as possible. So, in this video, I'll show you how to prevent scope creep on your project.

Do this with a 2-step process
1. Define the boundary with precision
2. Get sign-off
Yes, you need to deal with 'Autograph Top-trumps'.
But, even if you have to negotiate, at least you have a baseline for negotiation.

Get it right in the first place
a. Good requirements gathering

Your objective is not to prevent change. It is to manage it.
You need to keep it under control and good governance

as a project manager there are three
words that we fear more than any other
because our project is going well and
someone comes up to us and says could
you just could you just are the three
words that mean somebody wants something
extra from your project and that opens
the door to one of the most dangerous
things in project management scope creep
so in this video I want to look at how
you can prevent scope creep
[Music]
the reason why scope creep is so
dangerous is easy to understand if we
look at a simple graph
this graph represents the progress of
your project going from the start to the
end of your project it goes from zero to
100% completion it also represents the
usage of your resources be they hours of
people's time materials or budget once
again it goes from zero to 100% and it
typically follows this kind of s-curve
what's important about this curve is
what happens if you subtracted from 100%
to give you the curve for the depletion
of your resources the amount of resource
you have remaining which will now go
from 100 to 0%
the danger of scope creep is that once
you move past the initial stage of your
project you're using resources very
quickly
that means that if someone tries to add
additional scope to your project
you rapidly find that you don't have the
resources you need to accommodate that
change of scope without having a
significant impact on the deliverability
of your project and on your ability to
deliver that project to time and within
budget
therefore scope creep is dangerous and
we must do what we can to control it
Define Your Scope
the basic approach to control is scope
creep is a two-step process and step one
is to define your scope with precision
if this circle
represents the complete scope of your
project with everything inside the
circle being the things that are in
scope for your project and everything
outside the circle being out to scope
your first job is to characterize that
boundary to define your scope with
precision you must not only articulate
precisely what is in scope for your
project but you must also anticipate
that could you just that lead to things
falling out of scope so document a list
of out of scope items as well the
exclusions from your project
once you have all that documented
Show Your Documentation
second stage of the process is to take
that to your boss to your project
sponsor to your steering group or to
your client show them your documentation
of what you believe is in scope and what
is out of scope and ask them this simple
question if we deliver everything that
is in scope to the budget given us to
the time specified until the quality
standards you require will you be happy
and if we deliver none of the exclusions
will you be happy if they say yes and
get them to sign to show that they
authorized your scope statement
Scope Creep Example
once they've done that then when someone
comes up to you and says hey Mike could
you just you can look them in the eye
inside
I'm sorry I wish I could
I can't because my boss my client my
sponsor has signed to specify that this
is the scope I must deliver
Top Trumps
now the thing is I'm not naive I know
there is a tendency within your
organization and many others to play a
game that I call autograph Top Trumps
that's to say my boss's signature is
better than your boss's signature
Negotiate Changes
but even if that happens
because you've done the work of
documenting precisely what is in and out
of scope and therefore what your sponsor
will get for their money and in the time
available you have a firm baseline from
which to negotiate changes to scope
because this other person has a more
senior role than your boss than your
sponsor they can authorize the removal
of items from scope in order to
accommodate their desired changes or
they can authorize the additional budget
or the additional time add those extra
scope items to your project
Get it Right
the second thing I'd say is that in
order to control scope you need to get
it right the first time that's to say
you need to be excellent at requirements
gathering understanding the needs of the
different stakeholders and then
conducting a negotiation among those
stakeholders to balance the desires of
one stakeholder with the needs of
another and the needs of a third stake
holder with the Preferences of yet
another
valuable tools this you can use to help
you do that is Moscow analysis an
analysis of the musts the shirts the
Kurds and the once among scope options
and we have a video describing that in
detail
once you've conducted that negotiation
and recognized that you can please all
the people some of the time and some of
the people all of the time but you can't
please all of your stakeholders all of
the time once you've conducted that
negotiation it's essential then to
document that carefully to make sure
that the requirements are reflected by a
statement of scope and that statement of
scope is properly documented and signed
off
but remember preventing scope creep is
Solutions
not always your objective because the
world changes the needs of stakeholders
changes the competitive environment
changes technology changes legislation
changes everything changes and to be
dogmatic and to say no we are not going
to change the scope of this project ever
it's just foolish
there are two main solutions to this
problem and the first is a structured
change control process and again we have
videos on controlling change and a
long-form article on our website
change control is the process whereby
you control requests for change and you
make sure that each request for change
is supported by evidence of need and by
a statement of benefits to match up
against the costs
the other approach is to recognize that
some projects are inherently uncertain
at the outset we don't know for sure
what the right solution is going to look
like maybe the problem isn't fully
characterized and that's where the agile
style of project and hybrids between
agile and the more traditional
predictive approach to project
management really come into their own
because these approaches allow us to
iterate and successively redefine our
scope in a controlled way
your objective is not to prevent changes
in scope or scope creep your objective
is to control it to manage the process
and to ensure that there is good
governance around any scope changes and
good governance means a proper
consideration of the value of any
changes you make
a third approach suitable for more
traditional predictive project
management is to recognize that
significant changes of scope can be
accommodated by a second or a third
phase of your project a version 2 of the
product you're producing perhaps
this is a way of incorporating some of
the ideas of agile in to a more
traditional project structure
so the answer to the question how to
prevent scope creep is by careful
definition of scope and careful
management of the approval of that scope
but remembering that preventing scope
creep isn't your prime objective it's
controlling it as with everything in
project management bringing it under
control is what really matters
however you choose to manage it
controlling scope creep is vital
because uncontrolled scope creep
a killer of good projects please give us
a thumbs up if you liked this video I'll
be producing loads more great project
management content so please subscribe
to our channel and hit the bell so you
don't miss any of it and I look forward
to seeing you in the next video so to
answer the question how to prevent

# :: OVERSEW >> :
Looking ahead to Month 2 of your program, the focus shifts towards team collaboration and project management. This month is packed with activities that will demand efficient planning and coordination with peers. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key tasks and milestones you‚Äôll be handling:

1. **Project Scope Definition:**
   - Your team will start by selecting a specific problem to address.
   - You‚Äôll conduct research to understand the problem's impact, using data visualization to support your findings.
   - A clear project scope statement will be drafted, outlining project objectives, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions.

2. **Wireframing and Prototype Creation:**
   - The team will brainstorm and ideate on possible solutions, eventually deciding on one that uses technology.
   - You‚Äôll work together to create wireframes or even a 3D prototype for the proposed solution.
   - User feedback will be gathered through interviews to refine the prototype.

3. **Final Presentation and Video Pitch:**
   - A final video showcasing the prototype and a pitch for further development will be created.

4. **Career Development:**
   - The final week of Month 2 will focus on personal branding, including writing resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and preparing for job interviews.

### **Steps for Work Planning (Project Gantt Chart):**

To keep track of these activities, you can use a work plan (Gantt Chart) to map out tasks, deadlines, and ownership. Here‚Äôs a simplified example for Week 5-8:

| Category     | Action Item/Deliverables                              | Owner | Resources       | Start Date  | End Date    | Status      |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Milestone    | Decide on problem statement                           | Team  | Data, Research  | 16-Sep-24   | 20-Sep-24   | Not started |
| Milestone    | Conduct research and create data visualizations        | Team  | Laptop, Software| 21-Sep-24   | 25-Sep-24   | Not started |
| Milestone    | Brainstorm solutions and finalize an idea              | Team  | Brainstorm tool | 26-Sep-24   | 30-Sep-24   | Not started |
| Milestone    | Create wireframe or prototype                          | Team  | Design Software | 1-Oct-24    | 5-Oct-24    | Not started |
| Milestone    | Conduct user interviews and gather feedback            | Team  | Time, Resources | 6-Oct-24    | 10-Oct-24   | Not started |
| Milestone    | Refine prototype based on feedback                     | Team  | Design Software | 11-Oct-24   | 15-Oct-24   | Not started |
| Milestone    | Create video pitch showcasing solution                 | Team  | Video Editing   | 16-Oct-24   | 19-Oct-24   | Not started |

### **Project Scope Statement Essentials:**

1. **Project Justification:**
   - Why is the project important? Define the problem and its significance based on your research.

2. **Product Scope:**
   - Detail the specific features of your proposed solution (e.g., wireframe, prototype).

3. **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - What conditions need to be met for the project to be considered successful?

4. **Deliverables:**
   - Key milestones (wireframes, user feedback, video pitch) that need to be delivered.

5. **Exclusions, Constraints, Assumptions:**
   - Identify what‚Äôs not included, any project blockers, and key assumptions for successful completion.

By carefully planning these steps, you‚Äôll be in a great position to manage the collaborative workload in Month 2! Feel free to use the project scope template to stay aligned with your team and track progress effectively.

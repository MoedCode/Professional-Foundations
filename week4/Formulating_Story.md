It’s great to see that you’re now convinced of the power of storytelling in illustrating the problems we encounter in the world.

Storytelling is a fun and effective way to tackle problems because it:

1. Engages: It hooks your audience emotionally, making them invested in finding solutions.

2. Contextualizes: Stories provide relatable examples that help people understand the problem’s importance.

3. Reveals Patterns: Through storytelling, patterns emerge, revealing root causes and complexities.

4. Inspires Creativity: Stories spark creative thinking, encouraging fresh perspectives and innovative solutions.

5. Facilitates Collaboration: By sharing stories, you foster communication and collaboration among problem solvers.

Now, let’s dive into getting started with storytelling for problem-solving.

The best way to start is by conducting a Problem Impact Assessment.

A Problem Impact Assessment, helps you understand the primary stakeholders affected by the problem and how it impacts them. Recall the problem statement you crafted last week and take a moment to review it. Then, ask yourself the following questions:

1. Which groups of people are primarily impacted by this problem?

Individuals: Consider age groups, specific sectors, and geographic location.
Corporations: Think about industries, business size, and functional areas.
Public Entities: Include governments at different levels, non-profits, and NGOs.
Multi-national Organizations
2. How does the problem affect each group?

Consider areas such as lifestyle and quality of life, labour conditions, health and well-being (physical, mental, emotional), efficiency and productivity, safety and protection.

3. How does this impact manifest in their everyday lives?

Think about how the problem affects their daily routines and experiences.

4. How does this impact change their quality of life or outcomes?

Explore how the problem alters their overall well-being and results.

By addressing these questions, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to illustrate the impact of the problem more powerfully through storytelling.

 into an actual story. For this, don’t forget to use some of the tips and tricks you learned in the last module about how to build a powerful Story Arc.



Step 1: Identify a protagonist (that one stakeholder that you want to talk about)

What is the archetype of a typical person (stakeholder) that is impacted most by this problem? Where do they live? What do they do? Do you know someone who fits this profile? Give your protagonist a name and a character profile.

Step 2: Get into the protagonist’s shoes

What does your protagonist do daily? What’s the first thing they do when they wake up? Where do they go and what activities are they likely to complete? How does the problem show up in their everyday life and inconvenience them? How does it make their lives more difficult/challenging than it already is?

Step 3: Describe their situation in vivid detail

In this step, it’s important to write, as vividly and concretely as possible, how the protagonist encounters the problem in their everyday life. What are they doing when it shows up? How do they feel? What do they try to do to solve it, and what happens? Be as detailed as possible!

Step 4: Think about how things can change

Imagine what could be possible if certain factors or situations changed. What if an intervention could successfully alleviate this problem in your protagonist’s life? How would they feel? How would their life be better? What could change about their situation?

# Stakeholder vs Audience
Now that you have understood your chosen GCGO problem (Problem Statement) the stakeholders it affects (Problem Impact Assessment), and the stakeholder you want to use as your protagonist in your story – it is time to understand your audience. Who are you telling your story to?

The stakeholders and your audience are distinct entities.

Stakeholders are those directly impacted by the problem you’re addressing, while the audience refers to the individuals you are sharing your story with.

Stakeholders: These are the individuals or groups directly affected by the problem. When considering the impact on stakeholders, think about their experiences, challenges, and needs related to the issue. Understanding their perspective will help you create a more impactful and relevant story.

Audience: Your audience is the group of people you are presenting your story to. They may include stakeholders, as well as others who may not have direct involvement but have an interest in the topic. Tailor your story to resonate with the audience’s interests, values, and motivations. Consider how the story can engage, educate, or inspire them to take action or change their perspective.



Yes, we can and knew you needed that clarity :-)

# Understanding Your Audience

![alt text](image-12.png)
To improve on your story, it is also important to think about the audience that will be hearing it. To do so, you can ask yourself the following questions about your audience:

Role: What are the individual or group’s goals and objectives?
Triggers: What messages does this individual or group wish for you to prioritize/avoid?
Needs: What are their pain points/desires & how can you address them?
Communication Style: How does this individual or group like being spoken to?
Value to You: What do you want from this individual/group and how would that change the way you position the story?
For example, pretend you are a Kenyan startup founder speaking to a wealthy business owner based in the US about donating a small amount to your company as a philanthropic gift. Your startup involves selling a financial education app to schools and institutions to help young people with basic financial literacy skills and knowledge.

Role: Perhaps the business owner wants to find a way to bring good press for his company through this donation, or he simply wants to donate to support a cause he believes in; if the latter, perhaps you can focus more on the big vision of the organization and how it can change the trajectory of a young person
Triggers: You know that the business owner came from humble beginnings, so perhaps you can focus on how your startup helps young people from low-income backgrounds manage their finances better
Needs: Perhaps this business owner is at a point in his life when he wants to give back and feel connected to the youth; Perhaps you can then focus on how the donation can impact a specific group of young people specifically and highlight the story of one particular person you are already working with
Communication Style: As a business owner, this person probably wants to understand exactly how their donation will be used – they want the “ask” to be stated upfront, clearly and directly
Value to You: Your end goal is to secure the donation, so you are hoping to make clear what impact the funding will have


Think about it:

Sometimes, the items above are difficult to determine/find out because the information might not be readily available. What are some creative ways to find this information?

# In addition to understanding your audience, you can also employ some “persuasive appeals” to make your message more effective.

These are ethos, logos and pathos. Watch the video below to learn about what each of these appeals can do and how to employ them successfully.

Ask yourself as you watch:

Have I grasped the meaning of each appeal?
Have I understood how logos, ethos and pathos differ?
How does “audient awareness” come into play?

question mark
Let’s see…

Which of these elements did you observe being demonstrated in the videos you watched from the lessons “The Stories Behind Our Problems 1, 2, and 3”? Can you explain why?
Which one do you think will be the most effective for you?

the three persuasive appeals logos ethos
and
posos 2,300 years ago famous philosopher
Aristotle argued that there were three
ways to persuade someone and these three
persuasion appeals are the same modes of
persuasion used today by politicians
advertisements and public speakers
alike the first persuasive appeal is
logos or logical appeal logos is
persuading by appealing to one's logical
side through reason often through facts
statistics charts and
graphs the second persuasive appeal is
ethos or credibility appeal ethos is
persuading by establishing that the
Persuader is trustworthy often through
showing where one's information came
from or by using an expert or
testimonial the last persuasive appeal
and often the most effective is posos or
emotional appeal
p is persuading by appealing to one's
emotions and by creating an emotional
response such as sadness or
happiness it is also important to note
that good persuaders keep in mind the
target audience when using logos ethos
and posos this is called audience
awareness after all it wouldn't make
sense to show a toy commercial during a
late night talk
show in the end it's important to use a
balance of all three persuasive appeals
this will keep your audience engaged
while keeping their trust in
you so next time you're aiming to
persuade someone use all three
persuasive appeals then you can tell
everyone you're cool like
Aristotle

# dentifying Key Messages
Finally, you can ensure maximum effectiveness for your story if you are clear on the key messages you want to make sure your audience hears/understands/realizes.

Part of this is thinking through how you want your audience to FEEL, what you want them to THINK and what you need them to KNOW after hearing your story. Once you understand these three things, you can work backwards to determine how you want to position the key messages of your story.

Let’s think about it…

If you want your audience to feel infuriated/angry after your presentation, maybe you focus on a story of injustice.

If you want your audience to think that they have a role they can play, maybe you can share a story of how one person was able to make a difference.

If you want your audience to know about how the system is broken, maybe you can focus on a story of inefficiency and wastage.

Makes sense, right? First, decide on the end goal of your story, and then work backwards to effectively shape and position your key message.

 it is time to present this problem to an audience of your choice.

Based on your learnings, create a 400 to 500-word story related to your chosen GCGO problem for an audience of your choice.
Write your story in Google Docs.
The first part of your story should tell us:
As many details as possible about your audience. Who are they?
What is the key message that you want to deliver to your audience?
As you write your story, be sure to:
Identify your protagonist and follow the 4 steps needed to craft a powerful story.
Apply your understanding of your audience
Use persuasive appeals (Ethos, Pathos and Logos)
Be clear about how you want your audience to feel, think and know. #KeyMessage
Happy Writing!
Part 2: Peer Activity: Sharing Our Stories
Find 2 or 3 peers online or at your City Hub and conduct the following 60-minute activity.

Find a quiet spot where you will not be bothered to hold this activity.
Start by sharing who is the audience for your story.
Be ready to field any questions about your audience from your peers.
Next, read your story again without interruptions.
As each person is reading their story, other members of the group must take note of the following:
Who was the protagonist of the story and did you get a full understanding of what they were going through?
Did you get a full understanding of how the problem was impacting them?
How was the writer able to use their understanding of their audience to craft their messaging?
How was the writer able to use ethos, pathos and logos in their story?
What other techniques did the writer use to share a powerful story?
After you are done sharing your story, ask each peer to share TWO GLOWS (highlights) and TWO GROWS (areas of improvement) about the story. This means two positive pieces of feedback and two constructive pieces of feedback.
After all the feedback is given, you, the storyteller, can share your reflections and ask any clarifying questions as well.
Swap positions and repeat steps 1 -6 until everyone has shared their story.
On a GoogleDoc, kindly write your reflections from the exercise. This will help with the Week #4 Milestone submission later.

**John’s Struggle: The Story of a Small Business and City Traffic**

John had always been proud of the delivery business he built from the ground up. Living in the heart of the bustling city, his small delivery company, Speedy Dispatch, had become the go-to service for many local shops and restaurants. From early morning until late at night, John and his small team crisscrossed the city, ensuring deliveries arrived on time. For years, his business thrived, and John was able to support his family and provide good jobs for his employees.

But lately, things started to change.

The once manageable city streets were now clogged with bumper-to-bumper traffic at almost any time of the day. Congestion had gone from being an occasional nuisance to a constant nightmare. Deliveries that used to take 15 minutes now stretched into hours. Restaurants that relied on John’s team for quick food deliveries were receiving complaints from hungry customers. Local stores faced delays in getting essential supplies, hurting their sales.

John could feel the stress mounting. His phone rang off the hook with angry clients asking why their deliveries were late. The traffic jams weren't just slowing down deliveries; they were slowing down his entire business. And with every delay, John’s reputation was taking a hit.

His employees, once enthusiastic about the work, started to feel the pressure too. They spent more time stuck in traffic than making deliveries, and they weren’t earning as much due to missed opportunities. John knew he couldn’t afford to lose his staff, but he also couldn’t afford to keep losing business. Day by day, the situation seemed to spiral out of control.

One evening, after an exhausting day of missed deadlines, John sat down to reflect on the bigger picture. He wasn’t the only one feeling the impact. Thousands of small businesses like his, all across the city, were struggling with the same problem. Families were spending hours in traffic trying to get home, delivery drivers were stressed, and local commerce was suffering. The city’s infrastructure simply wasn’t built to handle the growing number of vehicles clogging the streets.

As the problem grew, so did John’s frustration. Why wasn’t more being done? He knew the city needed a change—better city planning, expanded public transportation, and stricter regulations on vehicle emissions to encourage more sustainable travel. But nothing seemed to be happening fast enough.

John realized he couldn’t wait for the city to fix everything. He needed to act now. He began advocating for solutions with other small business owners, raising awareness of the need for smarter transportation policies. He reached out to local government officials and attended city planning meetings. John believed that if enough people stood together, the city would be forced to listen.

His business was on the line, but more than that, the lives and livelihoods of countless others were at stake. The fight wasn’t just about delivery times anymore—it was about creating a better, more livable city for everyone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Takeaways:**
This story shows the emotional, practical, and economic toll that traffic congestion has on a small business owner. By using a protagonist that people can relate to (John), the story engages the audience emotionally (pathos), while also providing logical solutions (better transportation policies, city planning) to tackle the problem (logos). It aims to inspire city planners, government officials, and business leaders to take action, highlighting the human cost of failing to address congestion.



# Overview:
To transform the **Problem Impact Assessment** into a powerful story using the **storytelling structure**, you’ll want to follow the steps mentioned above. Here's an example that follows this structure:

---

### **Problem Impact Assessment**
**Problem**: Lack of financial literacy in underprivileged communities.
**Impact**: Individuals struggle with managing money, leading to debt, inability to save, and poor financial decisions, affecting their overall quality of life.

---

### **Step 1: Identify a Protagonist**
Meet **Lydia**, a 28-year-old single mother living in a low-income neighborhood in Nairobi. Lydia works as a cashier at a local store. She lives paycheck to paycheck, struggles to manage her finances, and is often caught in debt due to unexpected expenses and a lack of savings.

**Character Profile**: Lydia is hardworking, motivated, and dreams of saving enough money to open her own small business one day, but she’s trapped in a cycle of financial insecurity due to poor money management skills.

---

### **Step 2: Get into the Protagonist's Shoes**
Lydia's day starts at 5:00 AM when she wakes up to prepare her children for school. By 7:00 AM, she’s already at the store, working until late in the evening. Every day, she faces financial challenges: rent, groceries, school fees, and an unexpected medical bill last month threw her budget into disarray.

She often wonders how people manage to save money. Her job pays just enough to cover her basic needs, but Lydia lacks any form of financial education to help her manage her earnings effectively. She frequently takes out small loans from local lenders, which only worsen her debt.

---

### **Step 3: Describe the Situation in Vivid Detail**
Lydia’s financial struggles come to a head one afternoon when her boss calls her into the office. They’re cutting her hours, meaning her already small paycheck is about to get even smaller. Panic rises as she imagines falling behind on rent and the looming school fees for her kids. She tries to figure out a way to make her money stretch, but without knowledge of budgeting or saving, she feels lost. That night, as she tucks her children into bed, the weight of her financial problems keeps her awake, the worry gnawing at her, knowing she’s stuck without any tools to improve her situation.

---

### **Step 4: Think About How Things Can Change**
Now, imagine if Lydia had access to a financial literacy program specifically designed for people like her. Through this program, Lydia learns basic budgeting skills, how to set aside small amounts for emergencies, and how to avoid high-interest loans. With the guidance and education provided, Lydia slowly gains control over her finances.

Six months later, Lydia’s life looks different. She’s not wealthy, but she’s no longer living in constant fear of unexpected bills. She’s even started saving for her dream of opening a small business. With the tools she’s gained, she’s empowered, her confidence has grown, and she’s on a path toward financial stability.

---

### **Step 5: Understand Your Audience**
The **audience** for this story might be potential donors or investors who want to contribute to financial literacy programs. They could be corporate sponsors or philanthropic foundations who value empowerment and long-term change.

**Role**: The audience’s goals are likely aligned with making a meaningful impact on communities, particularly by addressing systemic issues such as poverty.
**Triggers**: Highlighting personal stories of individuals like Lydia who want to better their lives but lack the tools might resonate deeply with their values.
**Needs**: The audience wants to know that their contributions will create sustainable change, not just temporary relief.
**Communication Style**: Direct, with an emphasis on the real, human impact of the program.
**Value**: Lydia’s story shows how investing in financial literacy can change lives, making the case for why supporting such a program is worthwhile.

---

By presenting the story of Lydia, you appeal to **pathos** by showing the emotional and personal toll of financial illiteracy. **Ethos** comes from demonstrating that the proposed solution (financial literacy program) is a proven way to address the problem. Lastly, **logos** can be used by including facts and statistics on how financial literacy programs have improved the lives of individuals in similar situations, offering logical support for the story.

With these elements, you craft a powerful narrative that motivates your audience to take action.

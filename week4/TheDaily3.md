# Daily 3: Meditation


This week you will be adding the 3rd habit of the Daily 3 to your habits: Meditation!

Mindfulness meditation is simply the practice of relaxing the body and focusing one’s attention (on your breath or an object of your choice) to gain greater awareness of one’s thoughts and feelings.

So why should you meditate? This short 2-minute video offers several reasons. As you’re watching, ask yourself:

# Why meditate?


![alt text](image-1.png)

During Week 1, we discussed the powerful benefits of meditation. It can help with reducing negativity, stress, and anxiety, while also boosting positivity, focus, concentration, and overall well-being. Studies have shown its effectiveness.

Learning to meditate is like learning any other new skill. If you’re just starting, it will likely feel like exercising a muscle that you’ve never really worked out before. It will take consistent practice to get comfortable. So be patient with yourself and give yourself the opportunity to try it multiple times.


This week, we will explore the basics of meditation and guide you through a simple practice to help you get started. Whether you’re new to meditation or have been practicing for years, we challenge you to 7 days of daily 5-minute meditation practice. We invite you to notice what effect it has on you!

You might be thinking “I don’t have the time for this.” Well, did you know that even 1 minute of mindfulness meditation has measurable benefits? Numerous studies and testimonials demonstrate the marked benefits of meditation and mindfulness practices. We will share one such testimonial in the next few pages.

We hope you will develop a new habit with this ancient practice and enjoy its many benefits.

# Meditation: Challenge
Our challenge for you this week is to incorporate Meditation into your daily routine. This is in addition to your Daily 3 practices of Movement and Morning Pages. The three habits have immense benefits, so it is important to build and stick to each one.

So, for your challenge this week, here is what you need to do:

Follow this link to a list of 5-minute meditation videos for students or you can download a meditation app on your phone. Our favourite apps are:

https://www.wakingup.com
https://www.calm.com/
https://www.headspace.com
Pick a meditation that speaks to you so you can use it this week. We recommend picking one and sticking to it a few times. That way you build familiarity with it.

Decide on a time you will meditate every day and stick to it.

Get comfortable, play your chosen video and follow along.

Do this for 7 days straight!

You can choose to meditate without the video-guided mediation, but if you are new at this, the videos are the perfect companion to help along. Here is one short video that we like from the list above. You are welcome to follow along.


At the beginning of Month 2, we will ask you to honestly share one or two things that changed in your day-to-day life from practicing meditation. We are curious people and want to know if taking a few moments each day to be mindful added any benefits.

Happy Mindfulness!

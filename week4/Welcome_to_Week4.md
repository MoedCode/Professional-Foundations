# Intro to Week 4
![alt text](image-3.png)
Welcome to Week 4, Learners!
This is the final week in “Month 1” of the program! We’re almost into the transition week!

If you’re feeling what we felt after Week 3, then you’ll know that we’re right in the nitty-gritty and meaty part of the learning journey!

Last week, you donned your Sherlock Holmes cap and mastered the art of problem definition, problem-solving approaches, and web research techniques for gathering information.

This week, we’ll pick up right where we left off. You put in some serious effort and hard work last week and now it’s time to harness and transform it all into a compelling story. This week we will provide you with the tools and techniques to conduct research and use your findings to craft a narrative - and presentation - that captivates and leaves a lasting impact on your audience. This week will take your storytelling skills to the next level!

To give you a sneak peek of what’s in store, we have provided a video that offers an overview of the week ahead. While watching it, pay close attention to the following key points:

Milestone and Test Reminders
Requirements to maintain eligibility in the program after Month 1
Week 4 learning focus (building upon the foundations laid in Week 3)
The 2 peer activities
Guidelines for Milestone # 4
Submission deadline for both Milestone # 4 and Test # 4

We hope you are prepared for this week’s enriching experience.

 Week 4 Overview - Transcript


Hi everyone, it’s me, your facilitator Muhammad Khisal! Welcome to Week 4. The days are really cruising by, and it’s officially almost the end of Month 1! A big congratulations to you for successfully completing all the work in Week 3! You really are making great progress!

We know that Week 3 was very full and may have tested your limits. But we are confident in what you can achieve. At ALX we Do Hard Things and we refuse to settle for the ordinary. So, well done for tackling Week 3 and building the habits and skills that will set you up for success for a long time to come. You are making a huge investment in yourself, and we take our hats off to you for staying committed to your growth.

Last week we challenged you to incorporate Morning Pages into your daily routine. If you had a mic drop moment and successfully completed the challenge to practice Morning Pages every day for 7 days straight, you earned your bragging rights. We celebrate you and give you full permission to flex a little in your squads.

If you did not complete the challenge or maybe just managed to write on some days, we encourage you to reflect on the reasons for not being able to complete the challenge and whether there is something you can do differently to incorporate Morning Pages into your everyday routine this week. The benefits of practicing Morning Pages really speak for themselves and we want everyone to experience them.

Before we talk about Week 4, I have a few important requests and reminders:

So if you have any milestones or tests that you have not passed, please do them as soon as possible. As a reminder, you will be unenrolled from the program after month 1 if:

You have not passed Week 1 and 2 Tests.
You have not passed Week 1 and 2 Milestones.

We want you to succeed and stay enrolled in the program! So if you are behind, please catch up before the end of month 1 so that you can continue your journey with us.

Last week you spent time learning how to define and scope a problem, and you engaged with 2 problem-solving approaches: The McKinsey Method and the Cool Head, Warm Heart Method. You practiced asking the right questions and developed 3 research questions and a hypothesis.

Alright, we are really excited about this week. Let's dive into where your learning experience will take you in Week 4. This week is a continuation of the hard work you did in Week 3. This week you will deepen the skills you need to define the scope of the problem further, tell compelling stories, and create the perfect slide deck.

This week you will:
Continue to incorporate healthy habits into your routines and start practicing the last tool in the Daily 3, which is Meditation.
Strengthen your communication skills with some writing foundations, including storytelling and technical writing
Boost your storytelling abilities
Learn how to communicate better with tech teams
Get organized with work-planning practices, techniques, and tools.
Define your long and short term goals

This week, you will have 2 peer activities.
For the first activity, you will write a 400 - 500 word story, and find at least 2 peers to have a fun storytelling activity with. You can carry out this activity with your peers online, or at your City Hub if you are close to one. The storytelling activity will require at least one hour of your time.
The second peer activity will focus on your completed work plan. This is an essential element of your learning journey as you prepare for month two lessons and your team projects. Again, you will need to collaborate with at least 2 peers and set aside 1 hour to complete this activity online or at your city hub.

More information on both of these activities is provided in this week’s learning content here on Savanna. Please make sure that you give yourself enough time to do the work with your peers.

Week 4 Test is an automatically graded quiz that you will take here on Savanna. The list of topics covered on this test appears on the next page. Week 4 Milestone is a .pdf submission that will be a Google Slide deck. Your slide deck will contain a cumulation of work that you will complete throughout the week. These pieces are:

Your chosen GCGO and why it matters.
A clearly defined problem based on a GCGO.
Its impact on a specific target audience (#UserPersonas).
A couple of slides detailing the outcome of your research from last week.
A description of who you want to become (or perhaps a description of the kind of person needed to solve the problem you’ve selected) and the ultimate goal you want to achieve.
Your SMART goals to help you become that person and achieve your ultimate goal.

We have provided clear step-by-step instructions on the Week 4 Milestone pages.

We hope that you’ll find this week to be engaging and rewarding. As a master of your own learning journey, think ahead and allocate your time, energy, and focus accordingly. There is a lot of content to cover and new skills to acquire, so start early and work at it every day.

To grow, one has to push limits. We are confident in your abilities to tackle this week like the young leader you are. We know you did not come here expecting the ordinary. So buckle up, dig deep for that energy, and let's do this!

All the best with Week 4!

 # Overview:
 It sounds like Week 4 of the **Professional Foundations** program is packed with some exciting and vital learning experiences! Here’s a breakdown of what to focus on and how to tackle this week effectively:

### **Week 4 Overview**:
- **Storytelling & Communication**: Building on Week 3, you’ll be crafting a story and a presentation that leaves a lasting impression. Focus on the importance of structure—beginning, middle, and end—and make sure your story connects emotionally with your audience using **ethos, pathos, and logos**.

  For extra reading on storytelling techniques, you can check out *"Made to Stick"* by Chip Heath and Dan Heath, which explains how to make ideas more memorable.

- **Daily 3 – Meditation**: Incorporating meditation as the final piece in your Daily 3 practices will help improve focus and reduce stress. If you're new to meditation, apps like **Headspace** or **Calm** can provide guided sessions.

  You might find the research article *"The Role of Meditation in Enhancing Emotional Intelligence"* useful to understand the long-term benefits of incorporating meditation into your routine.

- **Technical Writing & Goal Setting**: This week introduces writing foundations, including **goal-setting techniques** like SMART goals. When setting both personal and professional goals, it’s important to create objectives that are **specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound**. This will help you keep track of your progress throughout the program.

  I’d recommend reviewing *"Writing in the Technical Fields"* by Mike Markel for detailed advice on technical writing.

### **Milestone 4 & Test 4**:
- Your **Week 4 Milestone** is crucial. You’ll be preparing a slide deck to define a problem based on a Global Common Good Objective (GCGO), its impact, and your solution. Make sure your slides are clear and concise.

  For some insights on creating impactful presentations, check out *Nancy Duarte's "Resonate: Present Visual Stories that Transform Audiences"*.

- The **Week 4 Test** will cover:
  - Problem Solving and Work Planning
  - Best Practices in Writing
  - Storytelling Techniques
  - SMART Goals

  If you need extra resources, **Savanna** will likely have plenty of reading material, but you might also benefit from exploring *"The Pyramid Principle"* by Barbara Minto, which delves into structured thinking and communication.

### **Peer Activities**:
- **Storytelling Activity**: Writing a 400-500 word story and sharing it with your peers is not just a fun exercise but also a way to sharpen your storytelling skills. Think about a time when a specific challenge or project taught you something profound.

- **Work Plan Activity**: This focuses on planning ahead for your upcoming team projects. Ensure that you create a **solid work plan** using tools like Trello or a Kanban board to keep you organized. The peer feedback will be critical in refining your approach.

### **Next Steps**:
Make sure you keep up with the milestones and tests from previous weeks, especially since falling behind might lead to unenrollment. If you need help, reach out to peers or use **Slido** for community ambassador support.

Lastly, stay consistent with your **Morning Pages** and **meditation** practice, as they will not only benefit you during this course but also beyond.

Good luck with Week 4, and remember: pushing your limits is where the real growth happens! Let me know if you need any further resources.

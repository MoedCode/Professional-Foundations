# Intro to Opportunity Identification


So we have defined a problem as a gap that exists between the current reality and desired outcome. Sometimes these problems are actually opportunities that need to be filled to reach a desired, more improved status.

Think of our phones or computers. Ever so often we are presented with software updates, or hardware upgrades not because there are issues, but also because there was an opportunity to improve that software or hardware to be faster, more effective, lucrative and user friendly.

In this module, we will talk about the various opportunities that exist in tech. As you study the information, keep your personal mission and team’s GCGO in the back of your head. We will use the skills that you have acquired over the past 2 weeks to brainstorm, identify and define the gap that lies between your chosen track in tech and your personal mission statement.

You will be using all the skills that you have acquired so far. Do you remember, them? Here is a quick recap.

Defining the problem (gap) and clearly articulating it as a SMART problem statement.

Asking the right questions to get the information that you need.

Web Research best practices and methodology: Your research can include analyzing trends, customer behaviour, pricing, and distribution channels. This information can help you identify gaps in the market, areas of high demand, and potential growth areas.

Understanding your ideal customer/audience through Audience Personas: By understanding your audience, you can create targeted solutions that resonate with their needs.

User Stories to understand the user’s goal, the context in which they will use the product or service, and any challenges they might face. User stories can help you identify opportunities to improve the user experience.

Problem Illustration to communicate the problem and potential solutions to stakeholders effectively. Visualizing the problem can help you identify areas where technology can be used to address the issue.

Technology: Finally, it’s crucial to consider the role of technology – and your chosen tech track – in identifying opportunities.

You see, identifying opportunities requires a combination of information and skills. By using problem statements, market research, audience personas, user stories, problem illustration, and technology, you can effectively identify opportunities and create targeted solutions that resonate with your personal mission and your target audience.

# The Power of Technology
Technology is a powerful tool for identifying and solving problems.

It opens up opportunities that normally would not have been possible before. Technology helps to automate processes, streamline workflows, and create new products or services that address existing problems.

For example, the rise of mobile technology has opened up new opportunities for businesses to reach their customers in real-time. Mobile apps can be used to provide personalized recommendations, track customer behaviour, and enable mobile payments.

Similarly, artificial intelligence and machine learning can be used to analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends, providing insights that can help to solve complex problems.

Blockchain technology is the foundation for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Cryptocurrencies have disrupted traditional financial systems by enabling fast, secure, and low-cost transactions across borders. Talk about answering a need that has not been met for centuries!

Technology has also enabled remote work, which creates new opportunities for businesses to reach customers in different locations or for employees to work from anywhere. Virtual reality and augmented reality can provide immersive experiences that can be used to solve problems in education, healthcare, and other industries.

This 2-minute video shares insight into how emerging technologies are bringing transformation.



By staying up-to-date with the latest technological trends you can identify new opportunities to create innovative solutions that address existing problems.

SPEAKER: Technology moves forward
at an ever-increasing pace.
Organizations are navigating an abundance of data, advances,
and opportunity.
We can't slow the rate of change,
but we can engineer a better future
by automating much of what's new and next.
Inside the organization, automation
can free us from repetitive manual processes
and elevate our IT professionals from those
who respond to problems to engineers who prevent problems.
Robots, drones, and other smart devices
need to be managed in new ways by IT.
AI-enabled cybersecurity can protect these assets
from proliferating attacks not just by automating threat
response but by helping analysts proactively focus
on prevention.
To amplify collaboration across organizations,
modern architectures and encryption techniques
enable us to automate data sharing
and develop new business models.
Cloud providers create modular business services
and accelerators that allow organizations
to easily assemble applications instead of writing custom code.
Advancements in blockchain and other distributed ledger
technologies automate collaboration
across organizational boundaries,
allowing more effective management
of tangible and digital assets.
As we look forward, technology will continue to accelerate,
and the flow of data will get stronger.

Software Engineering (Front-End and Back-End Development)
You probably have an idea of which one is of most interest to you. We encourage you to keep an open mind as you discover each area as it might be the solution to merging your personal mission with your career in tech.

# Opportunity Area: Big Data


Big data refers to the vast amounts of data generated from various sources that are too large and complex for traditional data processing applications to handle.

In recent years, there have been several technology trends in the big data space, such as cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

One of the most significant trends is the increasing adoption of cloud-based big data platforms. Cloud-based solutions offer many benefits, including scalability, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and ease of management. This allows organizations to store, process, and analyze massive amounts of data without investing in expensive on-premises infrastructure.

Another trend is the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) into big data processing. These technologies enable organizations to gain insights and make predictions based on vast amounts of data, which can help them make better decisions and improve operational efficiency.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is another significant trend in the big data space. IoT devices generate massive amounts of data that can be analyzed to gain insights into consumer behaviour, machine performance, and other valuable information.

Leveraging big data is critical for businesses to stay competitive and improve their operations. By analyzing large amounts of data, organizations can gain insights into customer behaviour, market trends, and other valuable information that can help them make informed decisions.

# Big Data in Action
There are many real-life examples of big data being used across different industries, including:

E-commerce: Companies like Amazon and eBay collect and analyze large amounts of customer data, such as purchase history, browsing behaviour, and search history, to personalize their product recommendations and improve customer experience.

Healthcare: Electronic health records (EHRs) and medical devices generate vast amounts of patient data, which can be analyzed to identify trends and patterns that can improve patient outcomes and treatment plans. For example, a hospital in Boston used big data analytics to reduce its readmission rates by 50%.

Transportation: Transportation companies like Uber and Lyft use big data to optimize their routes, predict demand, and reduce wait times. By analyzing real-time traffic data and customer behaviour, they can provide better service and improve their operations.

Finance: Banks and financial institutions use big data to detect fraudulent activities, identify investment opportunities, and improve risk management. For example, Goldman Sachs uses big data to analyze news articles and social media feeds to predict market trends.

Manufacturing: Manufacturing companies use big data to optimize their production processes, reduce waste, and improve product quality. For example, Ford uses big data analytics to monitor its assembly lines and identify issues in real-time, which allows them to make changes and improve its operations.

Overall, big data has become increasingly important across different industries, as it provides insights that can drive better decision-making, improve operational efficiency, and ultimately lead to better outcomes.

# Opportunity Area: Software as a Service


Software as a Service (SaaS) and solutions have become increasingly popular over the years, offering businesses and individuals a more flexible and cost-effective way of accessing software and technology solutions.

SaaS is a cloud-based service that allows users to access software applications and data through the Internet, eliminating the need for local installations and maintenance.

One of the significant benefits of SaaS is that it offers a more scalable and cost-effective solution compared to traditional software. Businesses can access the software they need without having to invest in expensive hardware or IT infrastructure, making it an ideal solution for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited resources. SaaS solutions are also typically charged on a subscription basis, meaning that users only pay for what they use, reducing upfront costs and making budgeting more manageable.

Another advantage of SaaS is that it can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, making it ideal for remote work and collaboration. This accessibility also makes it easier to manage and update software, ensuring that businesses are always using the latest and most secure versions.

# Software as a Service in Action


There are so many examples of SaaS solutions available today.

 Want to try to guess 1 or 2 SaaS Solutions that you probably use every day?

Did you guess any? Okay, here is our list:

Salesforce: A customer relationship management (CRM) software that enables businesses to manage customer interactions and data.
Dropbox: A cloud-based file storage and sharing solution that allows users to access and share files from anywhere.
Microsoft Office 365: A suite of productivity tools that include popular software such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, which are accessed via the cloud.
Zoom: A video conferencing and collaboration platform that allows remote teams to communicate and collaborate in real time.
HubSpot: A marketing, sales, and service software that provides businesses with tools to attract, engage, and delight customers.
Shopify: An e-commerce platform that enables businesses to set up and manage online stores.
Canva: A graphic design tool that allows users to create stunning visuals and marketing materials without the need for design skills.
These are just a few examples of the many SaaS solutions available today, and the list continues to grow as more businesses and individuals realize the benefits of accessing software via the cloud.

Let us take a closer look at the first example: Salesforce.

Salesforce Explained Intro
Salesforce
is everywhere.
But what the heck is it?
What's up, everybody?
I'm Brian Tong,
your guide
to all things Salesforce.
And this is Salesforce Explained.
It's the series
where an actual human, yes,
that would be me, answers
all your burning
Salesforce questions,
so all that tech jargon,
yeah, we're going to like,
throw that out the window.
Or at the very least,
just clearly define it for you.
Now, each week
I'm breaking down the fundamentals
of Salesforce and technology.
So make sure to subscribe
to the Salesforce Channel
and turn on those notifications
so you never miss an episode.
All right.
So today's topic is a frequently
asked question.
What is Salesforce?
What is Salesforce used for?
What is CRM
and how does it work?
Well, you know,
I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't give you those answers.
And maybe you've heard Salesforce
co-CEO Marc Benioff speak.
You might also recognize
the cloud logo
or the cute, friendly
characters like Astro
or the very big and very tall
headquarters in San Francisco.
Fun fact: it glows at night.
But because Salesforce does
so many things, we're always asked,
what does Salesforce actually do?
So let's break this down
in the simplest way possible.
Salesforce makes a software
that gives companies
a complete view of their customers
so they can build
What does Salesforce do?
deeper relationships.
Now, remember this thing?
Like,
this is how people and businesses
used to store important
contact information.
I've been told
they call it a Rolodex.
Now, it made it super easy to flip
to the contact that you need.
Just flip it around.
Then you dial them up.
You give them a little old
ring on the old landline.
But most of the relationships
were kept up here
with no way to share it.
Hey, the
1960s called
and they want the Rolodex back.
But today there's even more to know
about your customers and a lot more
you can do with that information.
So just like Beyonce,
let me upgrade ya...
Oh, oh.
Oh, oh.
Oh, oh.
Okay.
I'm going to get back
to what we were talking about.
Let's say you're running
a shoe company
and you've got a customer, Amelia.
You can know all kinds of things
about her,
like her purchase history,
she PR’d her half marathon
in those road shoes,
when and why
she called customer service,
because of that one time,
her package never arrived
(woops), that she attended
the in-store event last month,
and her running posture
is way better
since that form clinic,
that she subscribes your email
so that she can see
the latest
running news and race updates
and her browsing habits
on your website.
But knowing all this information
about your customer is called
Customer Relationship Management
or CRM, for short.
And Salesforce is the software
that allows you to see all that
and manage
your customers in one place.
And you're going to hear
that acronym
CRM a few times here...
still with me?
Yes?
Okay, good.
So let's get to part two.
What is Salesforce used for?
Simple.
Use it to really wow
your customers.
CRM software enables
a full view of your customers
so that you can provide
better experiences and build
What is Salesforce used for?
stronger relationships with them.
Think about it like rolling out
the red carpet.
You know,
many companies, big and small,
it doesn't matter the size.
They're frustrated or overwhelmed
by their customer data.
And a lot of times that data isn't
easy to understand or use
because the data doesn't
tell a story of who their customer
is or what they want.
Okay, let's remember
Amelia for a second.
Hey, Amelia.
Now, when we don't know things
about her, like how long
she had to wait for her
new shoes to arrive,
and we send her more emails
about those same shoes.
Well, Amelia
doesn't like that very much.
Salesforce helps
you keep Amelia happy.
It lets you see a view
of your customers
anywhere
they come into contact
with your brand
and how all
those experiences are connected.
It's kind of like
you've got Amelia here
at the center of your business
and then you can just draw
a circle around her,
connecting all her experiences
with your brand.
And boom, you just drew yourself
a 360 degree
view of your customer’s experience.
How about a
customer 360?
Yeah,
I said it like that for a reason.
And what is Customer 360?
Wow.
You know,
you all have a lot
of great questions today.
Like, keep them coming.
Well, we call our technology
Salesforce Customer 360 because
it's a collection of powerful apps
What is Customer 360?
that put your customers
at the heart of your business.
Now we'll be doing a deep
dive on Customer
360 in an upcoming episode
of Salesforce Explained.
So make sure to subscribe,
turn on those notifications
because trust me,
you do not want to miss that one.
So let's get back to it.
If providing customers
with a genuine personalized
experience is the
wow of Salesforce,
then breaking down silos,
connecting your company
and its data is the how.
And let's really look into that
for a minute because, yes,
the magic of Salesforce are those
wow worthy moments.
But if we don't understand
how that's actually done,
then I haven't done my job
to make your job easier.
So let's go back to the example
with our friend Amelia.
You know, I feel like
we're kind of getting pretty close
now, Amelia.
But it's not just you
who knows all this stuff
about her now.
It's everyone on your team.
So with customer 360,
everyone at your company
can access the information
that they need
to do their best work,
and they can collaborate and align
with teammates much more easily.
So when you have
this whole holistic view
of how
she's engaging with your company,
what she's buying,
if she's reading your
marketing emails,
what trouble areas
she's run into in the past,
your company can do
more of the stuff
that Amelia really likes
and your customer service reps
can resolve her
issues more quickly.
Your marketing team can send her
the info she needs
when she needs it
and not when she doesn't.
Your sales team
can sell her more
of her favorite products.
And there you go.
Suddenly your entire company
can create personalized experiences
all built around her preferences
so much more easily.
So, hey, let's do a quick
30 second recap.
All right. Go ahead.
Start the clock now.
Salesforce is a company
that makes cloud
based software
designed to help businesses wow
customers and build
lasting relationships.
Customer Relationship Management.
Remember? Now Salesforce
connects your teams and data
so you can work better together.
Customer 360
is our complete
portfolio of products,
and it unites our sales,
service, marketing, commerce
and IT teams with a single shared
30 second recap
view of customer information.
Your business uses
a single customer 360 app
or a combination of many.
Either way, Customer 360 helps
you grow relationships
with customers and employees alike.
Whew!
Did I make it?
I made it?
You know how we do.
All right, so you think we’d
be done right?
No, we're not.
We could not do a whole video
about what is Salesforce
without talking about
the most important thing.
Values, you see.
Salesforce believes business
is the greatest platform for change
and wants to work
with other companies
to make that statement a reality
in every way possible.
And that's
not just some fancy talk here.
Salesforce has these
five core values
and is committed
to living them out.
Trust,
customer success,
innovation,
equality
Salesforce core values
and sustainability.
Now one way they do that
is through the one, one one model.
This represents a commitment
of giving 1% of Salesforce equity,
1% of our product,
and 1% of employees’
time back to the community.
So with this model,
Salesforce has donated
more than half a billion dollars
in grants, 3.5
million hours of community service,
and provided product donations
for more than 39,000 nonprofits
and education institutions
since they started.
So, you know,
that's just like a little window
into the heart
and soul of Salesforce.
And I know
I'm throwing a lot out at you,
but when I said that,
I would answer the question,
What is Salesforce?
You know that
I had to give you the full picture.
And if you're asking,
where can I learn
more about Salesforce?
Hey, we got you covered
with lots and lots of resources.
For example, our free streaming
service, Salesforce Plus
and our free online education
platform, Trailhead.
Oh, you know,
I might be biased here,
but don't
forget about
one of the best resources,
this YouTube series right here.
So be sure to like, subscribe
and turn on your notifications
so you never miss an episode
of Salesforce Explained.
If you have more questions, hey,
drop the question
in the comments below
and you never know.
Your question
might appear on the next episode.
So take care everybody
and we'll see you next time.

- [Narrator] Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery
of IT resources via the internet,
with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Instead of buying, owning and maintaining
physical data centers and servers
you can access technology services,
such as computing power, storage and databases,
on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider
like Amazon Web Services.
Organizations of every type, size and industry
are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases,
such as data backup, disaster recovery,
email, virtual desktops,
software development and testing,
big data analytics,
and customer facing web applications.
For example, health care companies
are using the cloud to develop
more personalized treatments for patients.
Financial services companies
are using the cloud to power
real-rime fraud detection and prevention.
And video game makers are using the cloud
to deliver online games to millions of players
around the world.
With cloud computing your business
can become more agile,
reduce costs, instantly scale,
and deploy globally in minutes.
Cloud computing gives you instance access
to a broad range of technologies
so you can innovate faster
and build nearly anything you can imagine,
from infrastructure services
such as compute, storage and databases,
to internet of things, machine learning,
data analytics, and much more.
You can deploy technology services
in a matter of minutes
and get from idea to implementation
several orders of magnitude faster than before.
This gives you the freedom to experiment
and test new ideas to differentiate
customer experiences and transform your business,
such as adding machine learning
and intelligence to your applications
in order to personalize experiences
for your customers and improve their engagement.
You don't need to make large,
upfront investments in hardware
and overpay for capacity you don't use.
Instead you can trade capital expense
for variable expense
and only pay for IT as you consume it.
With cloud computing you access resources
from the cloud in real time as they're needed.
You can scale these resources up and down
to grow or shrink capacity instantly
as your business needs change.
Cloud computing also makes it easy to expand
to new regions and deploy globally in minutes.
For example, Amazon Web Services
has infrastructure all over the world
so you're able to deploy your application
in multiple physical locations in just a few clicks.
Putting applications in closer proximity
to end users reduces latency
and improves their experience.
No matter your location, size or industry,
the cloud frees you from managing infrastructure
and data centers so you can focus
on what matter most to your business.

```

# Cloud Computing in Action
Great examples of cloud computing include:

Cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive allow users to store and access their files and documents from any device with an internet connection.

Software as a Service (SaaS) providers like Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365, and Google Workspace offer software applications that are hosted and managed in the cloud, eliminating the need for users to install and maintain the software on their own devices.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provide virtualized computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and Google App Engine provide developers with a platform to build, deploy, and manage their applications in the cloud, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) such as Cloudflare and Akamai provide a distributed network of servers that help to deliver content, such as videos and web pages, to users quickly and efficiently from the nearest server location.

2023 is following a trend in cloud computing. Watch this video for more insights.

the top 5 cloud computing Trends in 2023
what we've seen now is mass adoption of
cloud computing lots of companies are
re-platforming to the cloud they're not
only using it for data storage but to
access services like artificial
intelligence Quantum Computing and
metaverse Technology as a service so
let's look at where we are in 2023 and
what some of the key trends are we will
have increased investment in Cloud
security and resilience as companies are
migrating to the cloud that brings huge
opportunities and efficiencies and
convenience but also exposes companies
and organizations to to a new range of
cyber security threats on top of this
there's a growing amount of legislation
now on how companies can store and use
personal data and this brings not only a
huge risk of fines but also the
potential loss of consumer and customer
trust so in 2023 there will be a lot of
spending on cyber security and building
resilience
and to make this cost effective because
there will also be an economic pressure
here we will see a greater use of AI and
predictive technology designed to spot
threats before they cause any problems
as well as increase the use of managed
security as a service providers
multi-cloud is an increasingly popular
strategy if 2022 was the year where
hybrid Cloud was really popular then in
2023 it will be the year of multi-cloud
approaches where businesses diversify
their services across a number of cloud
providers this helps organizations not
to become too tied in to just one
particular ecosystem and we also see
this move towards more containerized
applications which means that apps can
be quickly ported across platforms in
the event of changes to service levels
or when more cost efficient Solutions
become available
Ai and machine learning powered clouds
artificial intelligence and machine
learning is now available in the cloud
as a service but on top of that cloud
services and service providers are now
increasingly relying on AI and machine
learning themselves for a number of
tasks this includes managing the vast
distributed networks needed to provide
storage resources to their customers
regulating the power and cooling system
and their data centers and powering
cyber Security Solutions that keep their
data safe
low code and no code cloud services low
code and no code tools and platforms
allow anyone to create applications and
to use the data to solve problems
without getting their hands dirty with
computer code and this category includes
tools for building websites web
applications and designing just about
any kind of digital solutions that
companies may need low code and no code
Solutions are even becoming available
for creating AI powered applications
drastically lowering the barriers to
entry and and allowing anyone who wants
to leverage Ai and an ml to use it
straight away
Innovation and consolidation in cloud
gaming the cloud has broader streaming
services like Netflix and Spotify which
have revolutionized the way we consume
movies TV and music streaming video
gaming is taking a little longer to gain
a footfall but it's clearly on its way
with companies like Microsoft Sony
Nvidia and Amazon all offering services
in this field
this hasn't all been plain sailing we've
seen Google that spent millions of
dollars developing their stadia
streaming gaming servers only to retired
this year due to a lack of commercial
success but what we're seeing is with
the rollout of 5G and 5G plus we will
see a video streaming become a really
important Trend and also as the
metaverse emerges this will be become a
really important part of the cloud to
provide metaverse services

imagine you're the owner of a small
software development firm and you want
to scale your business up
however a small team size the
unpredictability of demand and limited
resources are roadblocks for this
expansion
that's when you hear about cloud
computing but before investing money
Onpremise vs Cloud Computing
into it you decide to draw up the
differences between on-premise and
cloud-based computing to make a better
decision
when it comes to scalability you pay
more for an on-premise setup and get
lesser options too
once you've scaled up it is difficult to
scale down
and often leads to heavy losses in terms
of infrastructure and maintenance costs
cloud computing on the other hand allows
you to pay only for how much you use
with much easier and faster provisions
for scaling up or down
next let's talk about server storage
on-premise systems need a lot of space
for their servers notwithstanding the
power and maintenance hassles that come
with them on the other hand cloud
computing solutions are offered by cloud
service providers who manage and
maintain the servers saving you both
money and space
then we have data security on-premise
systems offer less data security
thanks to a complicated combination of
physical and traditional i.t security
measures whereas cloud computing systems
offer much better security and lets you
avoid having to constantly monitor and
manage security protocols in the event
that a data loss does occur the chance
for data recovery with on-premise setups
are very small
in contrast cloud computing systems have
robust disaster recovery measures in
place to ensure faster and easier data
recovery
finally we have maintenance
on-premises systems also require
additional teams for hardware and
software maintenance loading up the
costs by a considerable degree
cloud computing systems on the other
hand are maintained by the cloud service
providers reducing your costs and
resource allocation substantially
so now thinking that cloud computing is
a better option you decide to take a
closer look at what exactly cloud
computing is
cloud computing refers to the delivery
of on-demand computing services over the
internet on a pay-as-you-go basis
in simpler words rather than managing
files and services on a local storage
device you'll be doing the same over the
internet in a cost efficient manner
Deployment Models
cloud computing has two types of models
deployment model and service model
there are three types of deployment
models public private and hybrid cloud
imagine you're traveling to work you've
got three options to choose from
one you have buses which represent
public clouds in this case the cloud
infrastructure is available to the
public over the internet
these are owned by cloud service
providers
two then you have the option of using
your own car
this represents the private cloud with
the private cloud the cloud
infrastructure is exclusively operated
by a single organization this can be
managed by the organization or a third
party and finally you have the option to
hail a cab
this represents the hybrid cloud
a hybrid cloud is a combination of the
functionalities of both public and
private clouds
Service Models
next let's have a look at the service
models there are three major service
models available es pass and sas
compared to on-premise models where
you'll need to manage and maintain every
component including applications data
virtualization and middleware cloud
computing service models are hassle-free
is refers to infrastructure as a service
it is a cloud service model where users
get access to basic computing
infrastructure they are commonly used by
it administrators
if your organization requires resources
like storage or virtual machines is is
the model for you you only have to
manage the data runtime middleware
applications and the os while the rest
is handled by the cloud providers
next we have pass
pass or platform as a service provides
cloud platforms and runtime environments
for developing testing and managing
applications
this service model enables users to
deploy applications without the need to
acquire manage and maintain the related
architecture
if your organization is in need of a
platform for creating software
applications pass is the model for you
pass only requires you to handle the
applications and the data the rest of
the components like runtime middleware
operating systems servers storage and
others are handled by the cloud service
providers
and finally we have sas
sas or software as a service involves
cloud services for hosting and managing
your software applications
software and hardware requirements are
satisfied by the vendors so you don't
have to manage any of those aspects of
the solution
if you'd rather not worry about the
hassles of owning any it equipment the
sas model would be the one to go with
with sas the cloud service provider
handles all components of the solution
required by the organization
Quiz
time for a quiz now in which of the
following deployment models are you as
the business responsible for the
application data and operating system
one is
two
pass
three
sas
four is and pass

# Software Engineering in Action
![alt text](image-10.png)

In 2024, the world of software development will continue to evolve with new trends and technologies.

One of the most prominent trends is the rise of low-code and no-code tools for app development. These tools allow developers to create apps without having to write complex code, which speeds up the development process and lowers costs. This trend is expected to continue in the coming years, as more businesses look for ways to quickly develop and deploy applications.

Another trend to keep an eye on is the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in software engineering. AI is being used to automate repetitive tasks and improve software performance. Developers who understand how to incorporate AI into their projects will be in high demand.

Finally, the trend of DevOps is expected to continue in 2024. DevOps involves the collaboration between software development and IT operations teams to deliver software applications quickly and efficiently. As more businesses move towards cloud computing, DevOps is now an essential part of the software development process.

Software Engineers are responsible for designing and developing these apps and tools, providing solutions to users. Let’s take a closer look at what Software Engineers actually do.

# Opportunity Area: Artificial Intelligence


via GIPHY

AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to learn and adapt.

AI is rapidly transforming the world around us, creating new opportunities and changing the way we work, live, and interact with each other. From improving healthcare to optimizing business operations, AI is changing the game.

One of the biggest opportunities that AI presents is the ability to automate repetitive tasks. This allows humans to focus on more complex and creative work, leading to increased productivity and innovation. In addition, AI can analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns that humans may not be able to detect. This allows businesses and organizations to make data-driven decisions that can improve performance and efficiency.

AI is changing the way we interact with technology. With the rise of personal assistants like Siri and Alexa, AI has become more integrated into our daily lives. AI can also create personalized experiences for consumers, such as tailored music playlists and movie recommendations.

AI presents numerous opportunities for improving efficiency and productivity in the workplace, advancing medical research and treatment, and creating personalized experiences for consumers.

When I think about the rise of AI,
I'm reminded by the rise of literacy.
A few hundred years ago,
many people in society thought
that maybe not everyone needed to be able to read and write.
Back then, many people were tending fields or herding sheep,
so maybe there was less need for written communication.
And all that was needed
was for the high priests and priestesses and monks
to be able to read the Holy Book,
and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church
or the holy building
and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us.
Fortunately, it was since figured out that we can build a much richer society
if lots of people can read and write.
Today, AI is in the hands of the high priests and priestesses.
These are the highly skilled AI engineers,
many of whom work in the big tech companies.
And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them.
I think that we can build a much richer society
if we can enable everyone to help to write the future.
But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies?
Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build.
They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers,
and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars
to build an AI system.
And the large tech companies,
particularly the ones with hundreds of millions
or even billions of users,
have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off
because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system,
such as one that improves web search
or that recommends better products for online shopping,
can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users
to generate a massive amount of revenue.
But this recipe for AI does not work
once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places
where, for the most part,
there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people
or that generate comparable economics.
Let me illustrate an example.
Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store
to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza
from the gentleman that owns this pizza store.
And his pizza is great,
but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around,
and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock.
But when I watch him operate his store,
I get excited,
because by selling pizza,
he is generating data.
And this is data that he can take advantage of
if he had access to AI.
AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data,
and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well
on a Friday night,
maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon.
Now you might say to me, "Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store.
What's the big deal?"
And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store,
something that could help him improve his revenues
by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him.
I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets,
and having more data does help.
But contrary to the hype,
AI can often work just fine
even on modest amounts of data,
such as the data generated by a single pizza store.
So the real problem is not
that there isn’t enough data from the pizza store.
The real problem is that the small pizza store
could never serve enough customers
to justify the cost of hiring an AI team.
I know that in the United States
there are about half a million independent restaurants.
And collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers.
But every restaurant is different with a different menu,
different customers, different ways of recording sales
that no one-size-fits-all AI would work for all of them.
What would it be like if we could enable small businesses
and especially local businesses to use AI?
Let's take a look at what it might look like
at a company that makes and sells T-shirts.
I would love if an accountant working for the T-shirt company
can use AI for demand forecasting.
Say, figure out what funny memes to prints on T-shirts
that would drive sales,
by looking at what's trending on social media.
Or for product placement,
why can’t a front-of-store manager take pictures of what the store looks like
and show it to an AI
and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve sales?
Supply chain.
Can an AI recommend to a buyer whether or not they should pay 20 dollars
per yard for a piece of fabric now,
or if they should keep looking
because they might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere?
Or quality control.
A quality inspector should be able to use AI
to automatically scan pictures of the fabric they use to make T-shirts
to check if there are any tears or discolorations in the cloth.
Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these
and to great effect.
But a typical T-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic
or retailer or school or local farm
will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today.
Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other T-shirt maker
that there is no one-size-fits-all AI that will work for all of them.
And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors
in other industries, even large companies
such as the pharmaceutical companies,
the car makers, the hospitals,
also struggle with this.
This is the long-tail problem of AI.
If you were to take all current and potential AI projects
and sort them in decreasing order of value and plot them,
you get a graph that looks like this.
Maybe the single most valuable AI system
is something that decides what ads to show people on the internet.
Maybe the second most valuable is a web search engine,
maybe the third most valuable is an online shopping product recommendation system.
But when you go to the right of this curve,
you then get projects like T-shirt product placement
or T-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting.
And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom-built.
Even T-shirt demand forecasting,
if it depends on trending memes on social media,
is a very different project than pizzeria demand forecasting,
if that depends on the pizzeria sales data.
So today there are millions of projects
sitting on the tail of this distribution that no one is working on,
but whose aggregate value is massive.
So how can we enable small businesses and individuals
to build AI systems that matter to them?
For most of the last few decades,
if you wanted to build an AI system, this is what you have to do.
You have to write pages and pages of code.
And while I would love for everyone to learn to code,
and in fact, online education and also offline education
are helping more people than ever learn to code,
unfortunately, not everyone has the time to do this.
But there is an emerging new way
to build AI systems that will let more people participate.
Just as pen and paper,
which are a vastly superior technology to stone tablet and chisel,
were instrumental to widespread literacy,
there are emerging new AI development platforms
that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code
to asking you to focus on providing data.
And this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do.
Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these.
Let me illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building.
Take the example of an inspector
wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric.
An inspector can take pictures of the fabric
and upload it to a platform like this,
and they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric look like
by drawing rectangles.
And they can also go in to show the AI
what discoloration on the fabric looks like
by drawing rectangles.
So these pictures,
together with the green and pink rectangles
that the inspector's drawn,
are data created by the inspector
to explain to AI how to find tears and discoloration.
After the AI examines this data,
we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears,
but not yet enough pictures of discolorations.
This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to reliably spot tears,
but still needs to further hone their judgment about discolorations.
So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolorations
to show to the AI,
to help it deepen this understanding.
By adjusting the data you give to the AI,
you can help the AI get smarter.
So an inspector using an accessible platform like this
can, in a few hours to a few days,
and with purchasing a suitable camera set up,
be able to build a custom AI system to detect defects,
tears and discolorations in all the fabric
being used to make T-shirts throughout the factory.
And once again, you may say,
"Hey, Andrew, this is one factory.
Why is this a big deal?"
And I say to you,
this is a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier
and equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI
to check for the quality of the cakes they're making,
or an organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables,
or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using.
Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years
before they're easy enough to use for every pizzeria owner.
But many of these platforms are coming along,
and some of them are getting to be quite useful
to someone that is tech savvy today,
with just a bit of training.
But what this means is that,
rather than relying on the high priests and priestesses
to write AI systems for everyone else,
we can start to empower every accountant,
every store manager,
every buyer and every quality inspector to build their own AI systems.
I hope that the pizzeria owner
and many other small business owners like him
will also take advantage of this technology
because AI is creating tremendous wealth
and will continue to create tremendous wealth.
And it's only by democratizing access to AI
that we can ensure that this wealth is spread far and wide across society.
Hundreds of years ago.
I think hardly anyone understood the impact
that widespread literacy will have.
Today, I think hardly anyone understands
the impact that democratizing access to AI will have.
Building AI systems has been out of reach for most people,
but that does not have to be the case.
In the coming era for AI,
we’ll empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves,
and I think that will be incredibly exciting future.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)

because I always wanted to turn on me
and I always wanted to build faster in a
way that I thought was best
um I couldn't proceed with a normal
career path I started most things on my
own but of course again with guidance
from mentors I want you to invest in
yourself keep learning and educating
yourself on everything new how I built
How to build resilience
the resilience to persevere despite
these challenges was by remembering the
mission why we started and where we're
going we get into the table was unique
about Nick about it and the customer
segments that will be open to that kind
of solution having that support system
Remember the mission
at hand will not only motivate us to
work the best we can at our startup but
also give us hope that if we keep on
doing what we are doing with passion
someday we are going to achieve the
results we are looking for you know go
Dont give up
after your dreams and do not do not give
up when people say no fall in love with
the problem that you're trying to solve
entrepreneurs solve problems we're not
just here to sell something and make a
profit off of it but it's how are we
solving issues that people have it was
challenging and the easiest thing I
could have done was to quit but then I
chose to discipline myself
Discipline yourself
startups despite their challenges are
probably the most fun time of any
entrepreneur's life
uh you know you see all of the odds that
Throw in the car
are stuck against you and you know
you're tempted to just you know throw in
the car and call it quits and so I don't
mind my mistake it gives you a different
level of experience so I didn't take my
Keep going
external circumstances or situation as
an excuse not to go through so every
time I feel like it's getting hard I
just you know remember that what I'm
working towards is something that is
bigger than myself and that Force alone
just keeps me going and you know makes
me want to you know you know pick up the
the towel and just keep going

# Problem Definition Recap


Do you remember the questions to ask when trying to define a problem and what tool you can use to do it more effectively? After Month 1, you should be singing these by now.

Lets recap:
To be able to define a problem more concretely and succinctly, we can use the 5Ws+H: Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How. These can be better answered by developing a problem statement, and a good way to develop an effective problem statement is to use a problem-solving framework.

In Week 3, we shared two frameworks: Cool Head Warm Heart Model and The McKinsey Problem Solving Framework..

The Cool Head Warm Heart framework is a decision-making approach with six key elements. Here’s a further summary of each element:

Helpful Frame: Clearly define the problem, identify stakeholders, determine the decision’s scope, and consider constraints and opportunities. Seek input from different perspectives.

Creative Alternatives: Generate diverse potential solutions that address the defined problem. Think outside the box and consider various viewpoints and approaches.

Useful Information: Gather and analyze relevant, reliable data to inform the decision-making process. Evaluate sources and synthesize information effectively.

Clear Values: Understand and prioritize the values and principles important to the decision-maker and stakeholders. Consider ethical, moral, cultural, and social aspects.

Sound Reasoning: Apply logical and critical thinking skills to evaluate the potential consequences of each alternative. Weigh pros and cons, assess risks and benefits, and anticipate unintended outcomes.

Commitment to Action: Make a final decision and take action based on the chosen alternative. Communicate, implement the decision effectively, and monitor outcomes to achieve desired results.

We simplified the McKinsey Problem Solving Framework, and you used it to complete your Milestones 3. This framework is commonly utilized in business and consulting contexts, proving especially valuable for data analysis and the development of data-driven and evidence-based solutions. This framework involves addressing six essential questions:

What is the problem?
Where and when does the problem occur?
Who is affected by the problem?
What factors will contribute to the success of a solution?
What are the boundaries or limitations of this problem?
Who or what may hinder the implementation of the solution?

Take time to jog your memory on each of these elements as this month, we will take problem definition a step further and allow our solutions to come to life.

# My Chosen GCGO


We also spent considerable time in Month 1 learning about GCGOs. You did a great job of defining and drafting your problem statement for your selected GCGO problem in Weeks 3 and 4! Your efforts in these areas are commendable.

Before we move on with our recap, take a moment to review:

Your Milestone # 3 Worksheet with your GCGO and problem statement.
Your Milestone # 4 presentation (and problem statement if it was different to the one you worked on in Week 3).
As you review, reflect on the main things you learned so far about the process of defining a problem.

Two questions for you…Given the opportunity to define your problem again:

How would you approach it?
Is there anything that you would do differently?
How would you do it differently?
Jot down your thoughts so you can incorporate any changes you would like to make to your problem statement later on this week.

Your problem statement from Milestones #3 and #4 is what you will bring to your first team meeting. So make sure you take time to review it before then.

# End of Module 5.3
Another one, done! Champion Vibes for sure.

Let’s take a quick break and enjoy this affirming song.

# Tasks
0. Individual + Team Activity: Reflection & Scoping the Problem
mandatory
Now that you have reviewed your Milestones # 3 and 4 it is time to prepare for your first team meeting.
This activity will build on the work you did for Milestones # 3 and 4 so please have both Milestones handy so you can easily reference them.

(If your Milestone # 3 is different to your Milestone # 4, choose one that you want to work with and have that close so you can reference it.)

Based on your understanding of the Global Challenge and Global Opportunity you chose and the problem you identified in Month 1, you will now identify 2 or 3 specific aspects of the broader problem that you would like to address as part of your peer project this month. This will help focus your efforts and allow you to delve deeper into specific areas of interest.

Instructions:
Complete the below steps in a Google Doc that you will share with your team.

STEP 1
1. In your Google Doc, write your chosen GCGO and the problem you identified as part of your Milestones # 3 and 4. If your Milestones # 3 and 4 speak to different problems, choose one you would like to work on further.



2. Reflect on the overarching topic you have selected and the specific problem you have identified within that topic.

Example: If your chosen GCGO is Infrastructure and the identified problem in your community is transportation for the elderly, think about specific aspects related to transportation that could be addressed.



3. Select 2 or 3 possible aspects to tackle: Zoom in closer to your problem and narrow down to 2 - 3 specific aspects within the broad topic that you would like to focus on during your peer project. These aspects should be specific and related to the problem you have identified. (There is no need to write these in your Google Doc as yet. You can just jot them down somewhere.)

Using the above example, our aspects are:

Aspect 1: Lack of Senior-Friendly Bus Stops: The lack of senior-friendly infrastructure at bus stops.
Aspect 2: Lack of a centralized information hub for informal transport services: lack of accessible and reliable information about informal transport services


4. Choose 1 aspect to focus on. Among the 2 - 3 aspects of your problem that you have come up with, select the one that intrigues you the most. Write it in your Google Doc.

Example: Among the three aspects we identified, our most intriguing aspect is the “Centralized Information Hub for Informal Transport Services”



5. Explain your reasoning: In your Google Doc write a brief explanation of why you have chosen the particular aspect and how you believe it contributes to addressing the identified problem.

Example reasoning

I have chosen Aspect 2: Centralized Information Hub for Informal Transport Services as it emphasizes the importance of accessible information to empower elderly citizens in utilizing informal transport services. Creating a centralized platform, such as an easy-to-use mobile app or website for the elderly, that provides reliable information about available informal transport services, routes, fares, and schedules empowers elderly citizens to make informed decisions and navigate the informal transport system with ease.

If we had chosen Aspect 1 our explanation would be:

Aspect 1: Senior-Friendly Bus Stops focuses on enhancing physical infrastructure to create an inclusive and comfortable environment at bus stops, By designing bus stops that cater to the needs of elderly citizens with features like comfortable seating, shelter, clear signage, and accessibility features, we can remove physical barriers and make public transportation more convenient and comfortable for them.



Remember, in Week 7 you will be prototyping/wireframing. So your chosen aspects should be one that will allow you (and your team) to develop a solution that involves some type of technology as a solution or partial solution.



STEP 2
In your Google Doc, use the McKinsey Problem Statement Framework to outline the different elements of the specific aspect you have selected, then come up with a Problem Statement for that aspect.

Remember, your statement must answer the 5Ws+1H.

Example
Using the McKinsey Problem Statement Framework, we will outline the different elements of our example problem and formulate a problem statement:

What is the problem? Limited accessibility to reliable information about informal transport services.

Where and when does the problem occur? This problem occurs in various locations in Africa, where informal transport services are prevalent. For this activity, we are focusing on Binga, Zimbabwe.

Who is affected? Elderly citizens who rely on these services and need accurate information to plan their journeys effectively.

What will make a solution successful? A successful solution relies on developing a user-friendly centralized information hub, ensuring widespread adoption and awareness among elderly citizens, and collaborating with informal transport service providers for accurate and timely updates.

What are the boundaries of this problem? The solution focuses on addressing the information gap specifically for informal transport services and may not encompass other modes of transportation.

Who or what can stop you from implementing the solution? Limited technological literacy among elderly citizens, inadequate internet connectivity in some areas, and resistance to change by informal transport service providers may hinder the implementation of the solution.

Problem Statement

The lack of accessible and reliable information about informal transport services severely impacts elderly citizens in various locations across Africa, who heavily rely on these services for their transportation needs.

Without easy access to accurate information, elderly individuals face significant challenges in planning and navigating their journeys effectively, leading to inconvenience, confusion, and potential safety risks.

The problem disproportionately affects the demographic of elderly citizens, who often have limited technological literacy and may struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving digital platforms.

Addressing this issue requires the development of a user-friendly and centralized information hub specifically tailored to the needs of elderly users, ensuring equitable access to essential transportation information and empowering them to travel safely and independently.



STEP 3
Each team member must share with the team the link to the Google Doc with their Problem Statement. Sharing can be done on the team Portal DM, and the document must be shared at least 4 hours before the first team meeting this week, so that the group has time to read through each Problem Statement.

Before sharing, ensure your Google Doc is set such that “anyone with the link can view it”.

During the first team meeting your group will decide on one Problem Statement to work on as a team.

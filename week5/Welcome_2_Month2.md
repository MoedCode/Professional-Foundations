# Recap: Month 2 Overview
As we shared with you last week and in this week’s welcome video, Month 2 is centered around a team project. You’ll work with the same team of 4-6 peers for weeks 5 to 8 of Month 2. Your team will decide on a problem, brainstorm solutions, select a solution, and create an initial prototype or wireframe of that solution. Your team will then showcase the proposed solution in a video and have the opportunity to be awarded funds to further develop it!

Here are some common questions about Month 2 and their answers…

Why will we be doing a team project for a whole month?

In most work environments, employees work together in teams on big projects that no one person could do alone. Working effectively with others is one of the most important and valuable skills you can bring into the workplace. You can certainly learn some collaboration skills through reading and studying about them, but there is no better way to learn about working with a team than to jump in and actually do it.

How will it work?

Over the entire Month 2, which takes place during Weeks 5-8, you will be working in a team of 4-6 people. You’ll be assigned to a team and will work with the same team for the whole month. Together, you will work towards your Milestones 5-7, which build on each other and culminate in a final video that showcases your month’s work. (The final video will be showcased for all learners and teams to see! We will tell you more about that when the time comes.)

In Month 2, you are required to meet with your team at least once per week for each of the 3 weeks. The meetings can take place online or at your nearest city hub, at a time when most or all of you can make it. It will be up to you to coordinate the meeting time with your team. We will provide you with an agenda/checklist of what you must accomplish at each meeting so that you make sure your team is on track.

What is the focus of the team project?

In Month 1, we spent a lot of time defining, researching and talking about problems. In Month 2, we will pay much more attention to how solutions are developed. Your team will decide upon 1 single problem that you will focus on for the month.

You’ll conduct some additional research on this problem and also create some visualizations of data that illustrate the problem, its impact, and its projected trend. Your team will then brainstorm and ideate to decide on a viable possible solution or a way to lessen the impact of your problem that leverages technology. Together, you will work to create a set of wireframes or a 3D prototype for your proposed solution. Lastly, you’ll create a video showcasing your work and making a pitch for your proposed next steps of development.

This whole process is broken down into the following Milestones:

Week 5:

Your team will decide on a single problem statement, conduct research, and provide evidence of its impact and trends (using data and visualizations).

Week 6:

Your team will conduct user interviews and brainstorm possible solutions, including using the “bad idea brainstorm” technique. You will then decide on a single problem statement and idea for a proposed solution (that uses technology), with an initial wireframe or prototype of that solution.

Week 7:

Your team will create a basic 3D prototype or set of wireframes for your proposed solution. Your team will then create a video that showcases your proposed solution and how it would work. The video will also include a pitch on how your team would further develop and test the solution and what would happen if it were successful.

Week 8:

You will work on developing and perfecting your Resumes, Cover Letters and LinkedIn profiles. You will also optionally create a pitch video of your solution as a team and submit it for a showcase.

Remember, this is just a high-level overview so you know where you’re going! We’ll provide you with step-by-step guidance all along the way.

# Recap: Month 2 Overview (cont'd.)


In case you have more questions, below are some commonly asked questions and their answers:

Question: Is my TEAM the same as my SQUAD on the Portal?

Answer: No, your project team is different to your Squad on the Portal. Your TEAM for Month 2 is made up of 4 - 6 peers who you will collaborate with on a project. Your SQUAD is your larger community on the Portal, which you have been a part of since the beginning of the program. In Month 2, you will spend most of your time engaging with your project TEAM, but we encourage you to keep your original (bigger) SQUAD community alive.

As a quick FYI, we sometimes use the term “GROUP” to refer to your Month 2 TEAM.

Question: Can I choose my team members or trade teams?

Answer: You have the freedom to choose your team members for the project. If you haven’t found a team yet, reach out to your peers on the portal to form a new team or join an existing one. You can find more information about this here.

Question: What if my team members are not working well together or we can’t find a time to meet?

Answer: In the real world, this happens too. It will be up to YOU to do everything in your power to get your team to meet and move forward on the Milestone. You should try to all get together in person, but if this is not possible, then some team members can call in (for example, via Zoom). Please be generous, considerate, and helpful to your teammates. You’re all in this together.

Question: Will my Milestone grade depend on our team’s output?

Answer: Yes and No. Each individual team member will still submit their own Milestone, but a big piece of what they submit should have been done in collaboration with the team.

Question: I’ve done group projects before, and there always seems to be someone who doesn’t carry their weight. What do we do if this happens to our team?

Answer: Sadly, this happens in the workplace, too. Sometimes, certain team members in a professional setting do not do their fair share of work. We recognize this is unfair, and yet it is somewhat common. We want you to have the experience of navigating challenging team situations and endeavor to communicate with team members about their responsibilities.  YOU have a responsibility to help your team do its work and to do it well.

Part of your Milestone grade is based on the team’s output, and part is based on your reflection on the team process. So, it will still be possible to pass the milestones even if the team output is not 100%. Just like in real life, sometimes you may have to be the one to get things done, even if this doesn’t feel fair.

Question: Where and when should our team meet?

Answer: Your team must meet_ at least _once per week, for a minimum of 3 times during Month 2. You are welcome to meet more frequently. Your meeting should ideally take place at your city hub. If this is not possible, you can mutually agree on a different location. If needed, some team members can dial in using videoconferencing. You will be given the contact info for people on your team and will need to coordinate your team’s specific meeting time and place.

Question: What happens if a team member drops out of ALX during the course of the month?

Answer: Team members leave suddenly from the workplace as well, and just as in that circumstance, your team needs to do as best they can to carry on and cover the responsibilities of the person who left.

We encourage you to have an open mind and a positive attitude. No matter what happens this month, one thing for sure is that you will learn about the complexities of working in a team. This is an incredibly important skill to bring into the workplace.

We don’t expect everything to go smoothly, but we expect you to practice a growth mindset and be willing to tackle the challenges that may arise.

# How to Find & Connect with Your Team
Assemble the Team

As you already know, Month 2 is all about collaboration. So, if you are yet to join or set up a team, this is your final call, you need to either set up a team or join an existing team. Please note that you cannot change teams and must work with your first team.



More Instructions on How to Find Your Team
All of your online communication will happen on the Portal. That means you will first identify your teammates, and then you will find and communicate with each other on the Portal. The Portal will be your method for effective collaboration and communication as a team.

Step 1: You either find a team to join or build your own team

If you are joining a team, make sure they are not more than 5 already. The maximum number of people in a team should be 6.

If you are building a team make sure you have at least 3 people in the team.

Once you identify team members, take note of their names. This way, when you join your Group’s DM on the Portal, you will know you are in the correct team.

How can you help make this process smoother for your teammates? Well, you can help make this process a little easier for everyone by ensuring your name and email used when registering for this program is the same as the one you have on the Portal.

Step 2: Create a Group DM on the Portal

The Portal is where the group will communicate and conduct online group activities. You are free to also communicate on other platforms outside the Portal if you need to, but you must first create a group DM on The Portal.

One person in your group should play the role of Team Leader.

The selected team leader is the person who is responsible to:

Take note of the names of those in the group
Mobilize the group to find other team members if there are fewer than 6 team members present
Create the first DM with all group/team members on the Portal.
The Team Leader should be the only person creating the Group DM on the Portal. If everyone in the team starts a Group DM on the Portal, you risk having too many group DMs, and this will hamper coordination and communication efforts for your team.

The Team Leader must create the Portal Group DM by the end of the day on Wednesday, so the team can start engaging as soon as possible.

Please make sure to create or join a group as soon as possible.

Special Note about the Selected Team Leader Role

If you are not picked as the team leader, please don’t worry. Once the team can communicate on the Portal, each team member can select a primary and backup role. You will have a chance to lead a specific area when the entire team is assembled and working on the project.

For the selected Team Leader

Here is a quick guide on how to create your Team DM on the Portal.

# Say Hello to Your Teammates


Once you have joined your Portal Group DM you can proactively break the ice by making a fun initial introduction of yourself to your team members by sharing:

Your name and location
Tech track of interest and why
What inspires you
The GCGO that you connect with the most
Your choice of Movement for the week
Days and times you are available for your first team meeting (which should happen ASAP).
After posting your introduction, also read introductions from your team members and engage in conversation. This will be your team for the next 3-4 weeks. Best to break the ice and get the conversation flowing now. This will pave the way for a productive, collaborative and rewarding team experience. It will also help you get your very first meeting scheduled sooner rather than later!

Happy Connecting!

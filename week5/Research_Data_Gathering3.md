# Optional: Spreadsheet Shortcuts

You can get things done using brute force on Google Sheets and Excel, or you can try to speak the systems’ language and adopt shortcuts. This will allow you to complete tasks much faster than you would be able to otherwise.

Here are a few more useful and handy shortcuts for Google Sheets. They are fairly similar for Excel as well.

## Common Actions

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Select column | Ctrl + Space |
| Select row | Shift + Space |
| Select all | Ctrl + A Ctrl + Shift + Space |
| Undo | Ctrl + Z |
| Redo | Ctrl + Y or Ctrl + Shift + Z |
| Find | Ctrl + F |
| Find and replace | Ctrl + H |
| Save | Every change is saved automatically in Drive Ctrl + S |
| Open | Ctrl + O |
| Print | Ctrl + P |
| Copy | Ctrl + C |
| Cut | Ctrl + X |
| Paste | Ctrl + V |
| Paste values only | Ctrl + Shift + V |
| Show common keyboard shortcuts | Ctrl + / |

## Cell Formatting

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Bold | Ctrl + B |
| Underline | Ctrl + U |
| Italic | Ctrl + I |
| Center align | Ctrl + Shift + E |
| Left align | Ctrl + Shift + L |
| Right align | Ctrl + Shift + R |
| Clear formatting | Ctrl + \ |

## Spreadsheet Navigation

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Move to the beginning of the row | Home |
| Move to the beginning of the sheet | Ctrl + Home |
| Move to the end of the row | End |
| Move to the end of the sheet | Ctrl + End |
| Enable screen reader support | Ctrl + Alt + Z |


# Tracking Down a Relevant Dataset
No need to be all over the place when researching, tracking, and collecting the right data that you need, thanks to effective data tracking.

Data tracking refers to the process of collecting, monitoring and recording various types of data over some time. It involves systematically capturing and documenting data points or measurements to analyze trends, patterns, or changes in specific variables or metrics. Data tracking can be performed manually or automated through technology systems and tools.

Data tracking is commonly used in various fields, such as business, healthcare, and research, to gather insights and make informed decisions. It allows organizations and individuals to monitor performance, evaluate progress, detect anomalies, and identify opportunities for improvement.

The data tracked can include numerical values, qualitative observations, or a combination of both. It can involve tracking data related to sales, website traffic, customer behaviour, health indicators, research experiments, project milestones, and more.

The key steps to track data effectively are as follows:
Set Clear Goals: Identify what you want to achieve through data tracking and what specific information you need.

Choose What to Track: Decide on the specific data points or metrics that are important for measuring progress or gaining insights.

Pick Tools or Systems: Use tools or software that make it easy to collect and manage your data, like spreadsheets or online tracking platforms.

Collect Data: Regularly gather the data you need, following a consistent schedule or whenever relevant events occur.

Organize and Store: Keep your data organized in a way that makes sense to you, whether it’s using folders, spreadsheets, or a dedicated database.

Check for Accuracy: Take time to review the collected data for any mistakes or inconsistencies, making sure it’s reliable and trustworthy.

Analyze and Interpret: Use simple techniques to make sense of your data, like creating charts or graphs to spot trends or patterns.

Share Insights: Communicate your findings with others who can benefit from the information, using clear and understandable language.

Monitor and Adjust: Regularly review your data tracking process, making any necessary changes to improve its effectiveness.

# Tasks

## Let's Apply Flowchart & Pseudocode for Ice Cream Parlor Problem

The most difficult thing in coding is to start from scratch because you don't have any idea about how to start or from where to take inspiration or information which will assist you in your work and sometimes it may haunt you during your entire coding journey but don't worry we will help you in your journey. This task will help you to understand an ice cream parlor problem.

### Instructions:
Before starting this task kindly go through each point so as to avoid mistakes at the end. Read all these points carefully before proceeding further.

1. First, understand the problem statement.
2. Develop the program logic (algorithm) using pseudocode by keeping these things in mind:
   - Identify all possible scenarios
   - Write down all steps required for solving this problem
3. Draw a flowchart based on your pseudocode.
4. Once done with Flowchart then write down at least 5 test cases for validation purposes which will help you in logic building for actual coding but it's not mandatory during submission of your task but recommended while actually doing it.
5. Use any tool like LucidChart, Creately etc., which is convenient for making flowcharts.

**Note:** You can use more than one page if required.

### Deliverables:
1. Pseudocode (Logic)
2. Flowchart

Once done with above two steps then only move forward otherwise kindly recheck what went wrong because next step is quite important before actual coding starts.

3. Test Cases (At least 5)

### Guidelines:
- Make sure that each step should be clear and understandable by someone who has no background knowledge about programming language or logic building.
- Your work should be neat and clean without any cutting or overwriting.
- If there are multiple ways to solve this problem then choose one way according to convenience but make sure that it should follow proper algorithm structure.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Understanding of Problem Statement
- Logic Building Skills
- Neatness & Clarity of Work

Activity: Web Research: Section C Part 2 of Week #3 Milestone Worksheet

THIS ACTIVITY FORMS PART OF YOUR Week #3 MILESTONE SUBMISSION.


Let’s put into practice everything that you have been learning. Complete this section AFTER completing the Canvas Modules on Web Research.

Have your Week #3 Milestone worksheet open so you can easily reference your Problem Statement and the work you’ve done so far.

This research will be foundational for your Milestone # 3 SECTION C Part 2 and 3 submissions.

You’ve been working on your Week #3 Milestone Worksheet to structure your research. You should have completed Section C Part 1 for your research questions.

Work on Section C, Part 2 of your Week #3 Milestone Worksheet and do the following (don’t make a new copy, and use the one you’re already working on):
1. Begin Gathering Your Required Information: Conduct a systematic search to gather the necessary information from your identified sources. Take notes and ensure that you collect data that directly relates to your research objectives and questions.

2. Evaluate the Validity/Credibility of Your Sources and Information: Assess the credibility and reliability of the sources you have gathered information from. Consider the authority, accuracy, objectivity, and currency of the information to ensure its validity for your research.

3. Synthesize and Communicate Your Key Findings: Summarize the key information and findings that you have gathered during your research. Organize these findings clearly and coherently, ensuring that they directly address your research objectives and questions.

4. Return to Your Original Objectives and Key Questions: Revisit your initial objectives and key questions to ensure that your research findings adequately address them. Reflect on whether your findings have effectively contributed to solving the identified problem.

Now, complete Section C, Part 3 of your research planning worksheet. Here is what you need to do:
In 200-300 words, provide an executive summary of your research. You should be synthesizing information from multiple sources. Provide answers and explanations for the 3 questions you investigated and your key research findings. This should be in a narrative format (no bullet points), and be at least 3 paragraphs long.

Please use at least 3 different online sources such as ChatGPT, organizational websites, Wikipedia, etc. Please cite (give credit to) where your information came from directly in your statement. Avoid word-for-word quoting and instead paraphrase (use your own words), as modeled in the example. Also list your sources and their urls (web addresses) at the end.

In case you need a bit of motivation, below is an example of a brief research executive summary and source references.

Example Executive Summary:
According to ChatGPT, increasing rhino populations requires multiple approaches. These approaches include anti-poaching measures; habitat protection and management; translocation and reintroduction; captive breeding and reintroduction; international cooperation between governments, conservation organizations, and communities; community engagement and education; and demand reduction.

According to ChatGPT, the following organizations are well known for wildlife conservation and protection: World Wildlife Fund (WWF), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), African Wildlife Foundation (AWF), Pathera, Conservation International, and The Jane Goodall Institute. These organizations engage in different practices to help wildlife. As one example, the World Wildlife Fund, according to their webpage, engages in protecting the land where animals roam, educating communities on the importance of protecting wildlife, and shutting down markets in Asia where ivory is sold.

Another example is the African Wildlife Foundation. According to their website, they focus their efforts on conservation education, anti-poaching efforts, habitat restoration, and policy advocacy. The Jane Goodall Institute is a final example. According to their website, they focus on environmental education and promoting sustainable livelihoods through conservation efforts. There appears to be several ways that reputable wildlife conservation organizations go about accomplishing their goal.

According to the International Rhino Foundation, a typical rhino pregnancy lasts around 16 months. According to the Maryland Zoo, Female white rhinos are able to start producing offspring when they are about 6 years old. A female rhino can give birth to one calf about once every 2-3 years. According to ChatGPT, a female rhino could give birth to as many as 14 offspring in her lifetime, but this is uncommon. Usually, conditions do not support this.

# Data Analysis Framework
The research recap serves as a powerful reminder of the remarkable progress you’ve made in the past few weeks. Your unwavering commitment to learning is truly commendable. With the recap still fresh in your memory, it’s an opportune moment to build upon your Week 4 insights and learn additional essential research principles, starting with the Data Analysis Framework.

What is the Data Analysis Framework?

The Data Analysis Framework is a structured approach used to examine and understand data. It involves asking key questions to gain insights into the problem or situation and preparing the data for a more in-depth analysis. This framework helps guide the process of extracting meaningful information from data sets.

Essentially, this framework is a set of logical and iterative steps that when followed appropriately support you in your data analysis.We have simplified these steps so you can follow them later on in this module.Let’s learn what each step entails.

Step 1: Understand the Problem

Do you remember your Month 1 lesson on understanding a problem?

Before you can solve any problem, you need to understand what the problem is actually all about. Half of the solution can be found when the problem is understood. The exciting thing is you are already a step ahead and have the tools you need to be able to understand a problem. You have:

McKinsey Problem Statement Framework
Cool Head, Warm Heart Model
Problem Statements
Step 2: Identifying Relevant Data

Finding the right data to solve the problem is the next crucial step in the problem-solving process. It involves understanding the intricacies of the problem at hand and then identifying the specific information or data points that will contribute to a viable solution. This process requires a thoughtful consideration of the problem’s context, scope, and objectives. Often, you encounter a problem before receiving tailored data, making it essential to decide which areas to focus on and what type of information is most relevant to address the challenge effectively.

Step 3: Obtain the Data

Once you’ve identified the relevant data needed to address the problem, the subsequent step is obtaining the information you need. This involves the active process of collecting the required data from various sources. While there are instances where data may be provided, more often than not, you or someone else on your team will be tasked with gathering it from different channels.

Remember, that just like any other bit of information in the world, data can be manipulated. So it is key to obtain data from a reliable source. We will learn more about how to tell whether a given dataset is legit or not.

Fortunately, this step on obtaining data is also not new to you and you as you already practised it during Week 4.

Step 4: Clean the Data

One thing you will realize when working with data is that data does not always come clean. What do we mean by clean?

We mean the data does not come well-organized, error-free and ready for analysis. Clean data is:

Accurate - Free of errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies.

Complete - Contains all the necessary information without missing values.

Consistent - Follows a uniform format and standard conventions.

Relevant - Includes only the data that is necessary for the analysis, excluding unnecessary or redundant information.

In the real world, there are many factors leading to unclean data. These include:

How data was collected: For example, people might answer the same survey question differently.
How data is inputted: For example sometimes one person may enter data in different ways or different people may enter data using various formats.
It is therefore very important, as someone working with data, to clean data so you can get what you need from it.

Cleaning data is a crucial task for anyone working with data. By ensuring data is free of errors and inconsistencies, you can extract valuable insights that aid in problem-solving. Clean data will allow for accurate analyses and better decision-making.

Think about this:

Which of the steps above do you think is the most important?
Which one seems to be the most difficult?
# Step 1: Understanding the Problem
There’s no better way to learn how to analyze data than to have a real-life case study! Here we go:

Your friend Lethabo runs an ice cream shop in Johannesburg, and he comes to you with a problem. According to him, sales have been slow over the last month, and he wants your help in thinking of solutions to improve his revenue numbers.

As you speak to Lethabo more, you find out the following:

Sales have dropped 15% in the last month (July) compared to the same month last year
The shop has hired 1 more person who started 3 months ago to help with managing the store and trying to bring customers into the store
The shop has been experimenting with different flavours while still keeping its most popular flavours on the menu (Chocolate, Cookies & Cream and Strawberry)
Recently, a nearby cafe has opened – while they sell other items like drinks and pastries, they also sell a limited selection of ice cream flavours
From Lethabo’s observation, customers have been spending more time in the store to eat their ice cream instead of taking their orders away
Based on what you know, which of the following do you think would be the key question we are trying to solve?

A. How is the newly hired employee affecting ice cream sales?

B. Where are the customers buying their ice cream if not at Lethabo’s store?

C. Why are ice cream sales at Lethabo’s store declining?

D. How many customers have stopped buying from Lethabo’s store?

Think about it…

The correct answer is C – we are trying to understand why ice cream sales at Lethabo’s store are declining. This is the core question. Items A, B and D may be useful for us as secondary questions, but the main question is to understand what is causing the decline in sales at the store.

Getting to the base questions and asking “Why” is the root of truly understanding the problems we face every day. This is a concept known as “First Principles”. “First Principles” is a fundamental principle of reasoning that involves breaking down complex problems or ideas into their most basic and fundamental elements. It is a way of thinking that involves starting from the very beginning, from the most basic truths, and building up from there to arrive at a conclusion.

Elon Musk has been known to use First Principles in his work at Tesla and SpaceX. Watch the video below to understand how he used this to come up with amazing space innovations!

In a competitive market, it is important to challenge conventional wisdom to broaden our horizons.

Reasoning from first principles does just that by asking "why?" By questioning EVERYTHING, it is possible to remove assumptions in order to deal with a problem in its most fundamental form.

This approach has been central to Space X's Elon Musk's method of problem-solving, and has helped him to achieve the "impossible".

```txt
Let’s say I want to go to space.
Now there are going to be all kinds of difficulties with that,
but the first one that comes to mind, and possibly the biggest,
is that I have no idea how to build a rocket.
So where should I start?
A good first step is probably going to be
to look at the blueprints of every successful rocket ever built
Every part of those designs was based on experience -
thousands of iterations of trial and error,
encountering and overcoming problems.
so matching my plans to theirs as closely as possible seems to make sense, right?
Well, maybe.
That kind of thinking is called “reasoning by analogy”,
and it’s great, up to a point.
But it’s also flawed, because it assumes that
the solutions past engineers settled on were the best ones.
And with the stakes this high, assuming anything probably isn’t a great idea.
Reasoning from first principles
So what’s the alternative to reasoning by analogy?
Well, it’s called reasoning from first principles.
Aristotle, Reneé Descartes,
and Immanuel Kant all talked about it at length,
and since then, it’s become a cornerstone of mathematical and scientific thought.
Most recently Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX,
has been very vocal about how central it is to his method of problem solving,
specifically to solve exactly the problem of getting to space
that we’re talking about.
In essence, reasoning from first principles means questioning everything.
Until you reduce the problem to its most basic truths,
You work those out and then build from there.
It removes all assumptions from the equation,
and allows you to deal with the problem in its most fundamental form.
SpaceX example
When Elon Musk founded SpaceX, he knew
that he could build rockets in the same way that other people had done before him,
but instead he decided to reason from first principles,
to see if there was a better way of doing things.
His main problem was a financial one - rockets are really expensive.
But why are they expensive?
That was the question he asked,
and he found that a huge amount of the cost was being charged by middlemen -
companies providing the components used to build the rocket.
So by vertically integrating, and handling the sourcing of all components internally,
he was able to reduce a significant amount of this cost.
On top of the middleman expense,
he realised that the rockets were never reused -
each time one of these insanely expensive machines was built,
it was destroyed after launch.
He thought that seemed crazy - so again, he asked why.
Why not land the rocket after launch, and re-use it?
Reasoning by analogy would say that landing a rocket is something
that NASA and the Soviet Union had both failed,
or not even attempted, to do -
so it stands to reason it must be near to impossible.
But rejecting that assumption, Elon Musk reasoned that
with the advances in technology since the problem was first tackled in the 1960s,
it may now be possible to land and reuse rockets.
As it turned out, he was right. And since SpaceX completed
the first successful landing of an orbital class booster in December 2015,
it’s become commonplace for these boosters to be launched multiple times.
Just by reasoning from first principles - just by asking “why?” -
Elon Musk changed the face of Space travel,
reducing the associated costs by more than 75 percent.
So admittedly, you personally might not want to go to space -
Conclusion
but that doesn’t mean you can’t apply this thinking to your work.
In a competitive market, this kind of approach is key
to broadening our horizons by challenging conventional wisdom.
Just asking why you do things the way you currently do them
sets you on the right path,
to be able to always look at the challenges you face with fresh eyes,
and analyse them for what they truly are, rather than what they seem to be.
```
# Step 2: Identifying Relevant Data for the Problem
After understanding the problem, the next step is to identify what data might be most useful or relevant in trying to direct your solution creation. For this, the key question to ask yourself is:

What data do I need to either prove or disprove the causes of this problem?
In other words, we have to start with a few key hypotheses and determine the data you need to either validate them or throw them out.

For example, going back to Lethabo’s ice cream store – the key question we are trying to answer is WHY ice cream sales have been declining. Let’s think about a few key hypotheses for why this might be happening:

Customers do not like the new flavours that the ice cream store is selling, so they are not buying as much.
Customers prefer to go to the new nearby cafe instead of to Lethabo’s store.
Customers are generally spending less on snacks or treats like ice cream.
Now, what data would you need to be able to either PROVE or DISPROVE the above hypotheses?

## Hypotheses, Data Needed, and Rationale

| Hypotheses | Data Needed | Rationale for Data Request |
|---|---|---|
| Customers do not like the new flavours that the ice cream store is selling, so they are not buying as much. | - Ice cream sales by flavour for the last 12 months | If past flavours have performed better than newer flavours, then this could be true. |
| Customers prefer to go to the new nearby cafe instead of to Lethabo's store. | - Customer NPS / satisfaction scores with both shops and why | If customers rate the cafe higher in terms of NPS and satisfaction, then customers may be shifting from Lethabo's store to the cafe. |
| Customers are generally spending less on snacks or treats like ice cream. | - Overall market trends for spending on snacks/treats, especially ice cream, in the last 12 months | If the entire ice cream market is experiencing declines in sales, then we know it is not just a problem with Lethabo's store. |

Think about this - What other hypotheses do you have and what other data might you want to get to be able to prove/disprove your hypothesis?

# Step 3: Obtaining the Data
After understanding the problem and identifying the relevant data you want to collect, it is now time to actually go out there and obtain the data. This may happen in any of the following ways:

You may be able to request for the data from the company or client you are working with
You may have to conduct primary research to collect the data yourself (i.e. through a survey)
You may have to conduct secondary research to find publicly available databases (i.e. online)
Below are a few important reminders if you are to use any of the three data-gathering methods above.

If you are requesting data…
Ensure that your data request is clear and succinct. Includeat leastthe following pieces of information:

Data name (e.g. “Order quantity”)
Description (e.g. “# of orders placed by customers for this flavour in this month”)
Unit of measurement (e.g. “#” or “KES”)
Timeframe (e.g. “Q1 2022” or “FY 2021”)
If possible, it is even better to send a template in Excel of how you would like to receive the data so the company/client can fill it in directly. An example is below:



If you are collecting the data yourself…
Be careful with how you phrase the questions on your survey or in your interview guide to make them as easily understandable and bias-free as possible. Ensure as well that all of your answer choices are standardized and “MECE” – Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive.

For example, if you were asking respondents about what price range they would be willing to pay for a specific product, you cannot list the possible answers on your survey as such:

10-20 KES
25-50 KES
51-100 KES
There are 3 problems with the choices above – (1) you have not provided an option for somebody to say that they want to pay less than 10 KES, (2) You have left a gap between responses (i.e. what if someone would like to pay 20-25 KES?), (3) you have not added an option for somebody to say that they are willing to pay more than 100 KES. In fact, for a question like this, it might be better asked as an open-text question where people fill in the exact amount that they would pay for the product.

Read this article and this article to learn more about the different types of survey questions and when you can use each.

If you are finding data online…
Perhaps the trickiest type of data to get your hands on is that which is publicly available on the internet – the reason for this is that you do not know how it was collected or whether the data is valid, so it’s important to be able to do the proper amount of diligence to determine whether the data is accurate and real.

Here are a few ways to easily pinpoint if data is reliable:

Check if your data is coming from a reputable site (i.e. World Bank data will be more reliable than data coming from a third-party agency that you have never heard of; similarly, government websites are also more reliable for country-level data)
Check to see if your data has any strange gaps/holes (i.e. when you download the dataset, it should look complete)
Check if the site where you are getting your data explains how the data was sourced/gathered
In addition to the above, you can also use the following techniques to check the validity of your data:

Find at least two sites so you can cross-reference whether the data points given on one site are the same as that on the other – if the numbers are off, then something is wrong
Identify trends – plot out the growth or declines in your data to see if there are any anomalies or outliers; typically, data will be roughly around the same range year over year unless there is a big event/catastrophe (like COVID)
Use your reasoning – for example, for population data, if the data is showing you that there are more people older than 60 vs. those younger than 20, then there might be something wrong as most countries have a larger youth population than the elderly population.

# Step 4: Cleaning the Data
Now that you have obtained your data, you need to prepare it for analysis so that you can draw reliable conclusions from your dataset. As mentioned earlier, data can be really messy, so it’s your job to clean it up!

Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is one of the most important ways of preparing data before analysis. Most of the time analysts don’t have control over the format and type of data that they are given to use, especially if they are importing from external data sources, such as web pages or a data file that is being updated by multiple users.

Before one can analyze the data, one often needs to clean it up. In doing so the analyst prepares the data for use. Spreadsheets have many features to help you get data in the precise format that you want. This week seeks to develop your data-cleaning skills.

In addition to cleaning the data, it is very important to note how data is presented in spreadsheets. Let’s walk through some basic prompts that will help during data cleaning and presentation.

Data Cleaning Checklist
The following is a checklist that you should mentally go through when cleaning your data.

Each column must have similar data (eg. all information on “last names”, “Color” or “Date of Birth” must be in their respective columns). This requires an understanding of what information is meant to be in each column.
Formatting should be consistent throughout the sheet (font, size, alignment, currency, date, time, etc).
Unless otherwise required do not shade in the cells.
Freeze the top row or the row that contains the column headings.
All columns and rows must be visible.
There should be no completely blank columns and/or rows within the dataset.
All columns and rows should be uniformly aligned (left, right, or centre).
General Checklist
Each question that you solve should be on a separate sheet/tab - each tab should be named appropriately. Example: “Question 1” OR “Yearly Revenue”
Make a glossary with the definitions of key terms
Make a copy of the “raw” dataset and name it as such
Always make a backup
Have you ever altered a document and after some time wished you had the original copy? This can happen to anyone. That is why you need to always back up your data. Working with data can be very tricky so it’s important to always have a copy of the original dataset to avoid unpleasant situations.

Most times the data you are working with will come in a form that requires you to download and convert or save in the right format to be worked with. As soon as you download the original dataset,  create a backup copy in a separate sheet. This way you can always refer to the original dataset in case you make a mistake.

We’ll be sharing some practical skills on how to go about cleaning and setting up data in the next module. See you there!

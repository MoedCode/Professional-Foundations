# Structure of an Agile Tech Team


By this time, you’ve heard the terms Agile Teams, Agile Methodology and Agile Framework quite a bit. Let’s explore what Agile is and how teams following this methodology function. Agile teams are typically small. They consist of about 5-9 team members with various roles. This section contains the breakdown of what an Agile Team typically looks like. Make sure you understand what each of the roles does as you’re most likely going to be working closely with people with such titles and responsibilities, or are going to have such a title yourself in the near future.

# Agile Team Structure: UX Researcher


UX is short for User Experience, in case you’re wondering what that means. A user experience researcher is responsible for several things within the context of an agile team. They work closely with product managers or product owners (or both) to identify user needs and expectations. This may involve conducting surveys, interviews, and usability tests to gather feedback and insights. They also analyze data gathered from their research work to identify patterns, themes, and insights that can help guide their product development. This can result in user personas that represent the different types of users who will be using the product. So in short, a UX researcher’s job is to find out what users want, and how best to achieve it.

We mentioned User Personas back there. What are they? We’ll go into details in the video below, and later in the course, but for now, you should know that personas help the development team better understand the users/customers and design solutions that perfectly fit their needs. It’s also important to note that user experience research does not just happen at the beginning of a project, it’s an iterative process that goes on throughout the lifecycle of a project.

The video below shows you what the UX researcher career entails. As you watch, pay close attention to the following key pointers among many important ones:

Primary research: Research you conduct yourself. E.g. when you interview users.
Secondary research: Research that uses information sources that someone else put together. E.g. Research from publications.
Quantitative research: Focuses on data that can be gathered by counting or measuring. This kind of research is usually represented numerically.
Qualitative research: Focuses on observations. usually based on interviews. Helps the interviewer understand things in detail. They want to understand the why behind some particular feedback.

SPEAKER: As we get started, it's important to keep in mind
that the role of a UX designer can look very different
at different companies.
At a larger company, like Google,
with thousands of employees, UX designers
often have a dedicated user experience research partner.
So designers don't have to do much research themselves.
But at a smaller company, one UX designer
might be responsible for both the UX research and the UX
design.
That's why it's so critical for you
to learn how to do both parts of the job.
Plus, having some research skills
can be really enticing to companies that are
eager to hire new UX designers.
Let's start with the basics.
UX research focuses on understanding
user behaviors, needs, and motivation through observation
and feedback.
The goal of user experience research
is to prioritize the user.
We also want to make sure business needs are met.
UX research can help bridge the gap between what
a business thinks the user needs and what the user actually
needs before an expensive and time-consuming product is made.
So how does UX research fit into the development of a product?
To answer this question, we need to zoom out and revisit
the product development lifecycle.
You may remember that the product development lifecycle
is the process used to take a product
from an idea to reality.
User research is a continuous part of the product development
lifecycle and takes place before, during,
and after phase 3, design.
Research that takes place before anything is designed
is usually called foundational research.
Some UX teams might also call it strategic
or generative research.
All three terms mean the same thing.
But in this course, we'll stick with foundational research.
Foundational research answers the question,
what should we build?
Additional questions you might ask
during this research phase are, what are the user problems?
How can we solve them?
The goal of foundational research
is to help define the problem you would
like to design a solution for.
This research includes talking with users
and identifying their pain points when using a product.
And guess what?
Sometimes foundational research reveals
opportunities no one on the design team
would have come up with.
Research that takes place during the design phase, phase 3,
of the product development lifecycle
is called design research.
Some teams call it tactical research,
but both terms refer to the same thing.
Design research answers the question,
how should we build it?
Here's a list of things you might
want to ask users about during this phase of research.
How was your experience using the prototype today?
How easy or difficult was it to use?
Why?
Did you encounter any challenges?
The goal of design research is to inform
how the product should be built. Design research
gives designers a chance to reduce
the problems that occur as users interact with your prototype.
You can conduct design research very early in the design
process when you have paper sketches,
or you can wait until you have a prototype to test with users.
It just depends on what your key research goals are.
The third type of user research is called post-launch research.
You might guess that post-launch research only
happens at the end of the product development lifecycle.
Post-launch research can be used to evaluate
how well a launch feature is meeting the needs of users.
Post-launch research answers the question, did we succeed?
The goal of post-launch research is
to understand how users experienced the product
and whether it was a good or poor user experience.
You might also want to check your product's performance
against the competition.
Next, let's discuss some of the key qualities
that UX researchers usually possess.
Qualities of a good UX researcher
include empathy, pragmatism, and collaboration.
We've already discussed empathy, which means the ability
to understand someone else's feelings
or thoughts in a situation.
Pragmatism is a practical approach to problem solving.
Pragmatic people are focused on reaching goals.
Collaboration is the ability to work with a range of people,
personalities, and work styles.
You already have all of these qualities.
All you need to do is learn how to apply them in your work.
The more you develop these qualities, the more capable
a researcher you can become over time.
So keep at it.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Let's talk about user research methods.
The term methods refers to how you get the research done.
There are many different ways to get
the answers we need from users.
And you'll decide which research method
to use based on the questions you need answered.
Each method has positives and negatives, which
we'll cover in another video.
Choosing the Right Research Method
Before we jump into each research method,
let's cover the basics.
There are two ways we categorize research methods.
The first way is based on who conducts the research.
The second way is based on the type of data collected.
So first, let's think about who conducts the research.
Primary research is research you conduct yourself.
For example, you might interview users, survey users,
or conduct a usability study to hear from users directly.
Secondary research is research that
uses information someone else has put together.
Secondary research can be information from books,
articles, or journals.
You've probably done secondary research before
and not even realized it.
Did you know looking at the statistics of a sports
team counts as secondary research?
Most of the time, secondary research
is done at the very beginning of the product development
lifecycle before any ideation happens.
Secondary research is often done by product leads, not
UX designers.
But the insights they share can help
you make a stronger case for your design choices
and gain more empathy for your users.
Another way to categorize research methods
is to think about the type of data collected.
Data can be collected through qualitative or quantitative
research.
Quantitative research focuses on data
that can be gathered by counting or measuring.
Quantitative research is often based
on surveys of large groups of people using numerical answers.
This type of research often answers questions like,
how many?
And, how much?
If you want to know how the majority of users
are experiencing a product, you should
use quantitative research.
On the other hand, qualitative research
focuses on observations.
Qualitative research is often based
on interviews, where we focus on a smaller number of users
and understand their needs in greater detail.
This type of research answers questions
like, why or how did this happen?
If you want to know why users are having
a bad experience with your product and how to improve it,
you should use qualitative research.
Here's a quick way to remember the difference.
Quantitative research gives you the what,
and qualitative research gives you the why.
So now that you know the basics of how we categorize research,
it's time to dive into some common research methods.
Let's start with interviews.
Interviews are a research method used
to collect in-depth information on people's opinions,
thoughts, experiences, and feelings.
Interviews are usually conducted in person
and include a series of open-ended questions
where the researcher asks the user about their experience.
Use interviews when your questions
require a detailed response.
For example, can you spot the difference
between these two questions?
How would you rate your experience
using the app on a scale of 1 to 10
versus how was your experience using the app?
The second question is open-ended
and allows the user to share more about their experience.
Next up, surveys, surveys are an activity
where many people are asked the same questions in order
to understand what most people think about a product.
Surveys allow us to hear from a larger number of users
than we can during interviews.
Surveys include a mix of quantitative and qualitative
questions.
Surveys are most useful after you
have some initial understanding of the user's pain points
and want to solidify that by surveying
a larger number of people.
Finally, let's talk about usability studies usability.
Studies are a technique that help us evaluate a product
by testing it on users.
The goal of a usability study is to identify pain points
that the user experiences with different prototypes
so the issues can be fixed before the final product
launches.
During a usability study, you get a chance
to see how your end users interact with your new product
or feature.
And afterwards, you can interview the users to learn
more about their experience.
The usability study data is then used
to improve the UX of the design.
If the product has already launched,
a post-launch usability study might include data
like success metrics and Key Performance Indicators, which
are commonly known as KPIs.
Key performance indicators are critical measures
of progress toward an end goal.
The KPIs for an app or new product launch
might include things like how much time the user spent
on a task or the number of clicks
they used to make a purchase.
You'll learn how to conduct your own usability study soon.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Remember what we mentioned earlier?
The research method choose depends on the question we're
trying to answer.
If we're just getting started with a project,
we might use secondary research to know the stats, facts,
and figures that already exist about our users.
For example, imagine you are designing a budgeting app.
Benefits and Drawbacks of Research Methods
You might want to review historical spending
trends of folks in their 20s.
Or you may want to learn what these young adults actually
spend their money on.
Chances are a credible study on this already exists.
Finding one can save your team time and money.
Plus, why redo work that's already been done?
Another cool thing about secondary research
is that it's immediately accessible.
Usually, all you need is a good internet connection.
Last, secondary research can be used
to backup your own primary research.
If users mentioned something during interviews,
you might want to find secondary research to back it up.
But there are also drawbacks to secondary research.
Secondary research doesn't allow you
to observe users interacting with your budgeting app,
so you will not have feedback on how
users feel about your product.
Next, let's talk about interviews.
Interviews allow you to understand what users think
and why.
During interviews, there is also an opportunity
to ask follow-up questions and really understand
the user's experience.
The main drawback is that interviews
take a lot of time and money.
This means you'll end up with a small sample
size, which can be risky when launching a brand-new product.
A compromise is surveys.
As we learned earlier, surveys allow
us to get feedback from a larger sample size of users.
Other benefits of surveys are they are fast and inexpensive.
You can hear perspectives from a lot of users very quickly.
One big drawback to using surveys
is that feedback from users is limited.
Survey questions don't allow for in-depth feedback.
Last but not least, let's think about usability studies.
Usability studies allow us to observe firsthand user
interaction with our product.
Our designs make sense to us because we
are the ones who created them.
But that doesn't guarantee they'll
make sense to every user.
Usability studies keep our assumptions
from getting in the way of acknowledging
the user's actual experience.
In addition, usability studies let the user
give in-depth feedback.
The drawback to usability studies
is that they only measure one thing, how
easy the product is to use.
Another drawback to usability studies
is that they are expensive because you
have to bring users into a lab and reimburse them
for their time.
Finally, how a user interacts with your product in a lab
environment is different than how they will actually
use it in real life.
All right, now you've got a basic understanding
of the benefits and drawbacks of four common user research
methods.
Next, we'll shift gears and identify biases in UX research.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
SPEAKER 2: Now that you know the basics of user research,
let's explore how bias can get in the way.
In this video, we're going to discuss how bias specifically
affects design work.
We'll examine six kinds of biases, confirmation bias,
false consensus bias, primacy bias, recency bias,
Identify Types of Bias in UX Research
implicit bias, and the sunk cost fallacy.
To begin, let's define the word bias.
In short, a bias is favoring or having
prejudice against something based on limited information.
It's like making up your mind about someone
before you've really gotten to know them.
We all have biases, and they're often unconscious.
While we can't completely get rid of biases,
we can be more aware of them and work to overcome them.
In UX design, this is critical to product success
and to your professional development.
Everything we've learned so far has shown us
that we aren't the user.
We've also learned how important it
is to put ourselves in our user's shoes
when making design decisions.
Biases can really get in the way of doing this.
Later, we'll get into the details of how this all
applies to your work.
The first kind of bias to be aware of is confirmation bias.
This bias occurs when you start looking for evidence
to prove a hypothesis you have.
Because you think you already have the answer,
you're drawn to information that confirms your beliefs
and preconceptions.
Let's say you have the preconception
that left-handed people are more creative
than right-handed people.
As you research, you'll tend to gravitate towards evidence
that supports this belief.
And you'll use it to build your case,
even though it's not necessarily true.
One of the most effective methods
for overcoming confirmation bias during research
is to ask open-ended questions when conducting interviews.
An open-ended question lets the person
being interviewed answer freely instead of with a yes or no.
You also want to get into the habit of actively listening
without adding your own opinions.
That means you aren't leading your interviewees
towards the answer that you want them to give.
Another way to avoid confirmation bias
is to include a large sample of users.
Make sure you're not just looking
for a small group of people who fit your preconceived ideas.
You want to have a big sample of users
with diverse perspectives.
Next step, let's look at the false consensus bias,
which is the assumption that others will
think the same way as you do.
In UX research, the false consensus bias
happens when we overestimate the number of people
who will agree with our idea or design, which
creates a false consensus.
It's possible for the false consensus
to go so far as to assume anyone who doesn't
agree with you is abnormal.
You can avoid false consensus bias
by identifying and articulating your assumptions.
For example, you might live in a community that often identifies
with certain political beliefs.
When you meet a new person, you might
assume they share your political beliefs because you
both live in the same town.
But that isn't necessarily true.
Finding a few people who do align with your beliefs
and assuming they represent the entire community
is a false consensus.
That's another reason to survey large groups of people.
Another kind of bias that affects designers
is the recency bias.
That's when it's easiest to remember the last thing you
heard in an interview, conversation,
or similar setting because it's the most recent.
When talking to someone, you're more
likely to remember things they shared
at the end of the conversation.
To overcome the recency bias, you
can take detailed notes or recordings
for each interview or conversation you have.
This way, you can review what people
said at the start of the conversation in case
you don't remember.
UX designers might also struggle with primacy bias,
where you remember the first participant most strongly.
Sometimes the first person you meet
makes the strongest impression because you're
in a new situation or having a new experience.
The primacy bias, like the recency bias,
is another reason to take detailed notes or recordings
so you can review everything that happened,
not just the memorable first impressions.
Recency and primacy biases also demonstrate
why you should interview each participant in the same way.
Consistency makes it easier to compare and contrast over time.
And consistency makes it more likely
that you'll remember the unusual and important moments that
happen throughout your research.
The next form of bias we'll cover
is implicit bias, which is also known as unconscious bias.
Implicit bias is a collection of attitudes and stereotypes
we associate to people without our conscious knowledge.
One of the most common forms of implicit bias in UX
is when we only interview people within a limited set
of identity profiles, such as race, age, gender,
socioeconomic status, and ability.
These profiles are generally based
on assumptions we have about certain types of people.
For example, implicit bias might cause you to feel uncomfortable
interviewing people whose life experiences
are different from your own.
On the other hand, we might choose to interview people
from typically excluded groups but then
ask potentially offensive questions
because of our internalized stereotypes.
Both of these scenarios are problematic
and lead to a lack of representation in our research
and design process.
The most important thing to note about implicit biases
is that everybody has them.
To overcome our biases, we can reflect on our behaviors
and we can ask others to point out our implicit biases.
That's one of the best ways we can become aware of our biases.
The last form of bias we'll cover is the sunk cost fallacy.
This is the idea that the deeper we
get into a project we've invested in,
the harder it is to change course
without feeling like we've failed or wasted time.
The phrase sunk cost refers to the time
we've already spent or sunk into a project or activity.
For example, you might think to yourself,
I might as well keep watching this terrible movie
because I've watched an hour of it already.
For UX designers, the sunk cost fallacy
comes into play when working on a design.
You might have invested hours into designing a new feature
but then learn that the feature doesn't really
address a user problem.
It's easy to keep working on a design
that you've invested time into.
But ultimately, you need to focus on work
that positively impacts users.
To avoid the sunk cost fallacy, break down your project
into smaller phases and then outline designated points
where you can decide whether to continue or stop.
This allows you to go back based on new insights
before the project gets too far along.
You're now familiar with the most common forms
of bias in user research.
It's important to know that there are other biases we
haven't covered here.
Bias is a limitation that extends well
beyond the fields of UX design and user research.
They can creep into the ways we make friends,
manage projects at work, and communicate
with family members.
Now that you know about these biases,
you might even start noticing them in your daily life.
The more that identifying bias becomes a habit,
the better you'll get at avoiding bias
in your design process.
As UX designers, we want to prevent biases
from getting in the way of accurate research.
You can always refer back to the glossary
if you need a refresher about these biases
and their definitions.
Keep these tips in mind for overcoming biases
and you'll be on your way.

Agile Team Structure: Product Manager


A Product Manager, also commonly known in modern tech lingo as a PM, is responsible for driving the vision, overall strategy, design, and execution of a product. This includes doing market research, competitive analysis, checking out customer feedback, and making sure that the team’s day to day are aligned with the business objectives. The Product Manager is also responsible for defining the product vision and making strategic decisions about pricing, positioning, and target markets.

The Product Manager may work with multiple teams, including sales, marketing, and customer support, to ensure that the product is meeting the needs of the business and customers (these are just a few examples of teams they collaborate with, the list is much broader and depends on the organization and the kind of product you’re building).

You should know, however, that not all companies have the product role specified to a Product Manager alone. Some companies might have different variations, the most common one being a Product Owner. A caveat with the two roles (PM and product owner) is that most teams, especially smaller teams from smaller companies, have only one of the two roles performing all duties related to backlog management and roadmap planning. i.e. instead of having both roles in a company’s technology team, you will just have the Product Manager or Product Owner.

The video below gives a fun walk-through of what PMs do on a daily basis. As you watch, ask yourself, have I understood:

The role that Product Management plays at the intersection of Tech, Business, and User Experience.
What PMs are responsible for in terms of:
Articulating what a winning or successful product looks like
Rallying the entire team on a specific mission to build and launch the winning product or feature.
Iterating until the winning product has been gotten right!
The purpose of The North Star metric.

hey yo it's khloe recently i have been
doing a lot of
talks with college students from all
over the nation
and one of the most common questions i
get is hey chloe
i am interested in being a product
manager but what is it that you even do
the product manager role is definitely
one of those really
buzzy and cool jobs to try to go after
it is highly sought after
it is well paid and it is very
respectable in the world of tech
so today i am here to tell you what it
is that i do on a day to day as a
product manager
so let's get started
What does a Product Manager do
[Music]
welcome to my channel colors of chloe i
am a product manager and i work in the
creator space
i have built features for many years now
and i have worked at boeing
google caffeine facebook and now at tick
tock
so now that's out of the way let's talk
about what a product manager does the
one thing that we do really is that we
launch features to make our users happy
our role is really at the intersection
of user experience
tech and business we are really involved
in crafting the look and feel of the
experience
we have to understand what are the
technical costs and what the tech debt
is
to help us prioritize what features to
work on and then we have to be very very
in tune with the roi is for the business
whether that's in revenue or user growth
or safety or pr
we have to know how it benefits us as a
Product Teams
business
though i really like to think about
product the way that todd jackson who's
a vp of product at dropbox has put it
pms are responsible for number one
articulating what a winning product
looks like
number two rallying the entire
cross-functional team to build it which
is a really
hard process and number three iterating
until we get it right so how it starts
off is like we really have to understand
how product is broken down into features
and experiences
like you're not just a product manager
of google you're not the product manager
of airbnb
you are staffed on a specific product
team that owns a very particular product
experience i couldn't quite understand
this concept for a really long time
until i started to understand how org
charts are created oftentimes companies
will separate different types of product
teams based on like different user
experiences
or maybe the different buttons that
exist on your platform
or maybe a combination of both so if
we're separating teams on
different user experiences people can be
staffed on product teams
that own the creator experience or user
growth
or ads and monetization or the creator
insights team
or even the viewer experience team if
you think about it from a buttons
perspective there's pretty much a
product team for every like cluster of
buttons that exist
like there's a team for the share button
the go live button
the notifications that pop up the admin
settings panel
the feed team the event creation flow if
there's any features that you roll out
as a pm that impacts other teams which
often times it does
you have to make sure that every team is
okay with what you're launching
because sometimes your feature might
take away from another feature for
example
rolling out instagram stories probably
took away from instagram posts
you know there are always these product
trade-offs to think through
North Star
[Music]
so let's pretend that we're on the
creator experiences team and usually
your leadership which refers to your
executives on the team
they set a north star that you have to
aim for
these are your metrics of success that
you're measured against this is a really
important metric to understand and to
define so i read this somewhere but
basically once upon a time
slack used to measure their north star
on the number of spaces that users
created
and that's not super meaningful because
like what if you have a bunch of spaces
that people create and nobody engages
with them that's not really valuable
you have to really understand what the
magical moment is
within the scope of your product team
and the users that you're serving
what is the aha moment for slack's case
it's really
getting to that point where you're
collaborating and working with your
teammates
that's what slack is all about so they
change their north star from
raw number of spaces created to
something more meaningful
which is their activation milestone and
that is like getting
a space to have three members and 3000
messages sent
and this is not random which a lot of
companies do which is pretty bad
but slack really did very deep analysis
on what their threshold is
for what spaces that exist that have
really great retention and they find
what correlates to that this is just
like facebook's aha moment where
facebook try to get as many users to
reach 7 friends in 10 days
this is the point where your users
finally get it if you know what i mean
Understand
so we as the product managers have to
really understand
number one who our users are what are
their user personas
how do they behave what are their
demographics what do they like what
don't they like
what are their pain points and what
prevents them from reaching the
experience that we want them to have
then the next step kind of is like
putting together design workshop where
you bring in all your cross-functional
partners we call them xfns
and we whiteboard out all the different
user profiles and then we figure out
which ones are most important to our
team
and then we analyze these specific
personas
and we're like can we come up with a set
of people problem statements to
understand their pain points then you
brainstorm all that
you prioritize which ones that are
important for you right now
and then for every single pain point for
every single people problem
you brainstorm all together what are all
the different feature solutions
that you could implement to solve their
problems so let me pause right there and
give you an example
and this is really outdated but a people
problem could be
as a new facebook user i have a hard
time finding friends who are already on
facebook
and then from that people problem you
can come up with all kinds of solutions
like it could be adding a suggested
friends list
or in the account creation process you
can import emails or contacts from your
phone
you can also browse other profiles based
on your network your school
ultimately you want to come up with
feature solutions that solve the root
pain point
that can help move the needle on your
north star
does that make sense and then after you
have all these ideas you prioritize you
ruthlessly prioritize
and then you build your roadmap and then
once you have your roadmap you start
working on the individual
features and you scope out the product
with your xfns you work with uxr
partnerships data product operations
engineering and ux
in the understand phase you really have
to deep dive into every single part of
this feature
you build the design mocs with your
designer and your copywriter or your
content strategist and you
simultaneously work with your data team
to understand the success metrics
and you put all of that into what's
called a prd which is a product
requirements document
this is your main direct deliverable i
mean your deliverable should be
launching the product and making users
happy
but like the thing that you have to
write up yourself and you own
is this document but once you have that
done you go through
so many rounds of review it's insane you
just have to make sure that
this feature is a net positive in the
grand ecosystem of things within your
product
and that takes really deep understanding
of your product so it's best that you
have a deep interest for the product
space you're working in
after your billion reviews then you hand
it off to engineering to do their own
technical review
they figure out end time edge costs who
needs to do what
is a client-side server side you have to
decide whether or not it needs a b
testing and after
you're ready to release like at least
the v1
you have to go through qa testing
release testing launch planning
we usually don't roll out features at
100 all over the world
we have to come up with a way to test it
in a small environment first
and then if everything's gucci then you
roll it out globally
and you have a launched feature you have
to work with data really closely to make
sure all of your events are logged
so that you can come up with proper
analysis and once you've launched we
make sure to celebrate
and then after a few weeks we come up
with a report out of the results
as well as a postmortem for what we
could have done
better and the whole process just kind
of repeats so once your career
progresses
you kind of just work on features that
are bigger and bigger and you work on
like big bet features
because we want to venture into like a
new space and yeah that's pretty much
the job
if i had to break down my job um it
would just be a lot of meetings and
a lot of writing it's like 60 meetings
30 documentation like i have a hundred
tabs on chrome that
there are different documents or
spreadsheets or design files
it's a lot and then 10 group chats
like for real especially because we're
remote now i wake up to
probably anywhere from 100 to like 400
messages in my group chats and not all
of them are that important but it's
important for me to be in a lot of these
group chats and then
respond back to stakeholders to get back
to them when things are being
released why something wasn't
prioritized why something is prioritized
and then just sending them the documents
that i constantly pump out so that's a
lot of discussion and deliberation i
know that sounded like a lot but i
really do enjoy being a pm
out of all of the various roles that
i've had in my career
being a product manager has been my
favorite in a future video i will share
exactly why i love being a product
manager so stay tuned on this channel
if you liked what you saw today do join
this community we welcome you with open
arms to learn about all things career in
tech
and the creator space come by twitch for
my co-working and co-studying sessions
and that's it
thank you for sticking around i hope you
have an excellent day or evening
wherever you
are and i will see you next time bye

# Agile Team Structure: Product Designer/ UI-UX Designer
OK, let’s start by revisiting the terms UX and UI, and then we can delve into the role of product design.

UX, as you already know, refers to User Experience and encompasses the overall experience a person has while interacting with a product, service, or system. It involves understanding users’ emotions, behavior, and attitudes during their interactions. For example, when you use Facebook, the way you think of the platform, what you want to do there, and how you want the platform to behave are all questions related to user experience.

UI refers to User Interface and is the specific point of interaction between the user and the system. It includes all the visual elements, such as screens, pages, buttons, icons, and any other visual elements a user interacts with. To continue our Facebook example, UI would essentially be the screen, buttons and how the videos, pictures and colors appear that you see when you turn on the app.

Product Designers often work hand in hand with UX researchers and Product Managers to conduct user research, ensuring that they gain a deep understanding of the user’s needs, pain points, and goals. They’re also responsible for turning the insights learned from user research into wireframes and prototypes, which are visualizations of the design solutions that attempt to meet the user’s needs. They also go a step further and think about holistic product metrics such as user retention, growth or user acquisitions, customer drop-offs, etc.

Take a moment to watch the video below which gives an in-depth comparison of the roles. As you watch think about these questions:

Do you understand the difference between UI, UX and Product Design?
Does product design appeal to you?
Whom do you think is best suited for these roles among your squad?

So what does a “day in the life” of a Product Designer look like? Take a look at the next video by a Product Designer with her hands in many jars namely, Research, Design and Requirements syncs with the team.

gonna stop calling it relab live now
we're gonna call it relab academy
if you're familiar with our online
course it's called
realappreallab.academy go and check it
out
it talks about product design the stuff
that you see here as well
a lot of the times but um today i'm
going to talk to you about the
difference between ui
ux design and product design or digital
product design man i've been getting
some backlashes
about calling it product design because
people think about it as
industrial design which is traditionally
kind of true these days though when
people talk about product design
they can refer product design as digital
product design so here just to be
specific
it's going to be about digital product
design to explain this to you i'm going
to get into my ipad and we're going to
do a little bit of a
scribbling so let's get into it all
What is UI Design?
right guys so
we're here looking at the difference
between ui and ux designer
versus product designer so the first
thing that we need to look into is what
is the difference between ui
and ux first of all oftentimes people
combine it as
as ui and ux but they're actually two
different things so if i can quickly
explain what the difference is
ui design stands for
user interface user interface so
the things that a ui designer is
concerned about most of the time is how
do
things look and interact and um how do
they gel together
do they work with the brand or not and
stuff like that and i'll get into that
in a second
so if we were to look at the difference
between sorry what's under ui design
it'll be you know things that you would
typically think of
visual design so it'll be things around
design elements
so design elements are things like
fonts layout
[Music]
colors and one
what not right and the other things that
ui designer thinks about are oftentimes
interaction
so it'll be interaction
they do a lot of prototyping as well
[Music]
so stitching up a prototype prototyping
ui designers these days as well get
involved a lot in design systems
so i'll just write down design systems
there
a lot of the design elements these days
include motion work as well so animation
or motion
is another thing that ui designers or
interface designers
think about
and of course in the world of web you've
got responsive design
so responsive and
lastly but definitely not the least
important is accessibility
ability so these are just some examples
of the type of
things that ui designers or user
interface designers look into
in their daily lives and the things that
they are most concerned about and
oftentimes those are front end stuff
things that that talks about the brand
and the visual elements basically now
What is UX Design?
let's get into ux design so ux design
as most of you would know is user
experience
or some people call them experience
designers
when we when it comes to user experience
on top of
ui which is user interface oftentimes
people think about
the user itself so they're most
concerned about what the users think
what their experience is like what the
their behaviors is like
so it's basically about understanding
personas
who the user is putting themselves into
the customer or the user shoe is very
important as a ux designer
they think about journeys user journeys
they think about user flows
information architecture is another
thing
our architecture
and uh usability
that's why a lot of user researchers or
user designers would
go into a b testing user testing
usability testing and all
sorts of stuff like that because they're
really just trying to understand
what the behavior is like that it
informs them on what actions to make
or to recommend and there's also a
category called ux writing so writing is
actually
a thing in user experience because a lot
of the times it's
it's more than just visuals it's more
than just technical stuff
but it's also about tone language and
how you deliver the voice
of a brand or or whatever you wanted to
do in the product
so that's basically ui and ux and
oftentimes when people talk about ui ux
designers it's basically these things
combined between
ui design and ux design depending on how
big or small the company
is the larger the company the more
specific the role is so you've got ux
writers you've got ux researchers
and then in a midsize company they might
have just ux designers who does
everything around ux and
like little startups for example or
small businesses
they'll have ui and ux designers
combined because basically you just need
one person to do all of that together as
a catch-all thing
What is Product Design?
now we'll get into product design which
is where the confusion is
uh these days so in terms of product
uh design the things that they are most
concerned about
is more than just the user interface or
the user experience
but it's quite specific to the product
that they look after
so if i was to take an example of an
uber
as a company or an unpleasant let's
stick with the uber for now
and uber they have multiple different
products whether it be the driver's app
or the customers app or even their own
internal applications
their website and so on and so forth so
each of those platforms
are called products so a product
designer for uber's
let's say driver's app would solely
focus on
the driver's app itself and he or she is
part of that
driver's app team as a product designer
so if i was to
map out the things that a product
designer would be most concerned about
are probably in addition to user
interface
and user experience stuff they would
also add elements about
understanding the adoption of
the product itself so they'll be
thinking a little bit more about
the business more than just the user
interface or user experience
they'll think about factors like
conversion which is oftentimes by the
way is also part of user experience but
conversion is even more important
because
they are going to think about the brands
or the products specifically
and also retention
how do they keep users engaged with
product
how do they come back to the app again
and again
and after that what happens in terms of
trying to get
users to advocate the the product or the
app
as an example uh so therefore advocacy
is also something that product designers
think a lot
and also growth so growth means it's
more than just a one-off project
it's a life cycle of a product where
else do we optimize
what do we need to remove what do we
need to eliminate
and then from there you know do
iterations and do
different versions so product designers
are very much
engaged with their one product or their
product focus
as opposed to doing multiple projects
oftentimes in different
in different scenarios it might be
different but as a rule of thumb that
that's what generally happens and so
i guess from a skill set point of view
if you're in university
or you're just learning ui or ux design
or product design
actually there's not a lot of product
design courses and i do get a lot of
questions in our
youtube comments just asking what
exactly is product design
as a rule of thumb you can think about
it as first and foremost you're a
designer whether you're a graphic
designer
a web designer a ui designer whatever
but it depends on what you wanted to
focus on
if a product is what you want to want it
to focus on there's so much
opportunities these days because there's
so many
new startups new companies new
businesses and digital is just part of
their dna
and product is oftentimes something that
comes with their service whether it be
an
app a website an e-commerce store or
whatever it is
but a product digital product design is
very
important uh for you to learn about if
you wanted to get into
the digital design business um
so i'll just summarize very very quickly
Summary: UI/UX Designer vs Product Designer
here
so if we talk about ui
ux versus
product
the questions that a ui ux designer
would typically ask is is
the product or the design is the product
or design
easy to use
um how can i make
the experience oops
how can i make the experience
more user-friendly
and if i can add another thing how
can i reduce
friction because you're trying to make
everything seamless for the user
in the experience
now in addition to this in product
design
obviously you'll also think about all of
this stuff which is how easy is it to
use
and can it be more user-friendly can we
reduce friction
but in addition to that product
designers would also think about
is the product
um a right fit for the economy
a right fit
for the current economy
economy and
product designers will sometimes also
think about
um you know does the does the product
align with the business goal
a line with
the business goal
or the stakeholder's goal whoever owns
the product um
[Music]
go and
just to add one more thing because i
like things even
um is how can i make
oops
[Music]
how can i
make the design
cost effective
[Music]
cost effective even like things like
consistent
is very important consistency
flexible
and scalable is actually a very
important thing
for product designers particularly
because
it's all about scale and how we can
optimize how we can grow more
efficiently
and you might hurt you might have heard
these days about roles called design ops
so design ops comes from this in in
development world there's actually
devops who looks after servers and how
things migrate from one
from one uh host to another and stuff
like that
in product design there's this role
called devops where they look after
design systems they make sure things are
easily scalable they make sure things
are well tidied up in the library in the
in the components library the patterns
and all of that stuff to make sure that
when product designers come in as a team
they work together or when the new
designer comes in it's very easy to hand
over things and to onboard them
into the system so that's what a lot of
design ops people do
and yeah they think about consistency
flexibility scalability
and how efficient and cost-effective
things can be because oftentimes uh
companies that owns product will be tied
into a budget so managing budget is also
very important
so as a whole product designers would
think about some of the business side
a little bit more than i would argue ui
and ux designers
but in addition to that they actually
complement each other and as a matter of
fact there
they come from the same background and
the same skill sets
now i'll leave it there do leave us a
questions i'll be more than happy to
answer
um your inquiries uh otherwise if you
enjoy this video guys make sure you
like subscribe comment and share it to
your friends
family colleagues whoever who would find
it is useful
other than that i'll see you in the next
one thank you folks

Introduction
Bom dia!
Me chamo Femke,
sou designer de produtos e atualmente trabalho na Uber.
Quero mostra-lhe um pouco como é meu dia a dia
como uma designer em uma grande companhia de tecnologia.
Se você estiver assistindo isto no futuro,
estamos em abril de 2020
e estamos no meio de uma pandemia global.
Esta será uma edição home office de um dia na minha vida.
Não vai refletir exatamente como é um típico dia meu no escritório,
mas, ainda assim deve dar uma ideia
de como é minha vida como designer na Uber.
Vamos começar com o dia!
UM DIA NA VIDA DE UMA DESIGNER DE PRODUTOS EDIÇÃO HOME OFFICE
Getting ready for the day
Bom, começo meu dia tomando vitaminas e sempre preparo um smoothie.
Há dois anos comecei a fazer smoothies todos as manhãs antes de trabalhar e...
Bom, acho uma boa maneira de consumir pelo menos 5 frutas e vegetais por dia.
Normalmente, me exercíto antes de prepará-lo.
Corro ou faço yoga,
mas neste dia em específico acho que eu não fiz nem ou nem outro.
Então, esta sou eu apenas preparando meu smoothie.
Geralmente, depois de bebê-lo, me preparo para pedalar até o escritório,
mas hoje, obviamente, estou trabalhando de casa,
então é uma viagem bem rápida até o escritório dentro de casa.
A 1ª coisa que faço ao chegar na minha mesa
Starting my workday
é conferir meu calendário.
Vejo que hoje meu dia começa com uma sessão de pesquisa
em que faremos testes de usabilidade.
Depois, na metade do dia, temos uma sessão de trabalho de produto,
em que nós, os designers de produtos, nos juntamos
e trabalhamos em qualquer questão pendente,
problemas, requerimentos, prioridades.
É uma reunião muito produtiva.
Depois, temos uma sessão de design com uma companhia externa
com a qual estamos trabalhando em um projeto.
Em seguida, uma CP4,
que significa Checkpoint (verificação) 4.
Na Uber Eats, usamos um processo de Checkpoints
ao longo do nosso processo de design e de produto
e o CP4 é basicamente o último Checkpoint antes de lançarmos o produto.
Portanto, estamos muito próximos de lançar o que estivemos trabalhando
pelos últimos 6 meses, mais ou menos.
Então, esta é a última verificação antes do lançamento.
Muito bem, agora é hora de me preparar para a sessão de pesquisa.
User Research Session
Oi! Aqui é a Femke da Uber.
- Olá, como vai? - Bem, e você?
Esta sessão de pesquisa foi conduzida pela nossa pesquisadora de usuários
que faz parte de nossa equipe.
Ela está orientando toda a reunião e a conversa.
Durante esta sessão, entramos em Mural
para fazer um pouco de co-design
com os usuários com quem estávamos testando.
Aqui vimos alguns cenários diferentes
e os deixamos prencher as lacunas,
o que nos permitiu ter uma percepção do que eles estavam querendo
dentro deste produto no qual estávamos trabalhando.
Eu quero ser o mais transparente possível com você neste vídeo
para mostrar, de forma sincera, como um dia de trabalho em casa é.
Isso significa roupa confortável,
nada de maquiagem.
Sabe, estando tranquila, casual e confortável.
Breakfast + goals for the day
Bom, há cerca de duas horas que começamos o dia.
Vim preparar o café da manhã.
Geralmente, eu o preparo assim que chego no escritório.
Já que estou trabalhando de casa, relaxei um pouco e tenho comido mais tarde
e as vezes nem sequer como.
Também preparei uma caneca de chá,
que é meu ritual favorito pela manhã.
Eu não bebo café,
então sobrevivo bebendo bastante chá.
Hoje, estou bebendo capim-limão e gengibre.
Falta cerca de uma hora e meia até a nossa sessão de produto,
na qual faremos algumas verificações
sobre onde estamos na nossa visão a longo prazo de 18 meses
em que estamos trabalhando.
Isso me dá cerca de uma hora e meia para terminar alguns dos conceitos.
Comecei a trabalhar neles no início desta semana,
há cerca de 3 dias.
Ontem à noite conferimos, em equipe,
para ver em que etapa está cada um e garantir
que a apresentação fluisse e que os conceitos estivessem alinhados.
Então quero usar um pouco do feedback da nossa reunião de ontem
para atualizar alguns dos designs, terminar alguns conceitos
e me certificar de que minha parte da apresentação funciona
e que está alinhada com a visão da equipe.
Isso é o que farei pela proxima uma hora e meia.
Deep Work design time
Muito bem, voltei para o meu escritório com minha caneca de chá
e estou pronta para começar uma sessão de 90 minutos de puro trabalho.
Durante estes períodos de foco total,
tento me distrair o mínimo possível.
Sempre desligo as notificações no meu computador de trabalho
para não me distrair muito.
E acabou sendo um momento bem produtivo, consegui terminar o que eu queria fazer.
Você pode ver que vez ou outra eu mudo entre Figma e o Google Apresentações.
Eu estava exportando o meu trabalho do Figma
e botando-o no nosso arquivo do Google Apresentações
onde temos trabalhado em equipe.
Diga oi a minha gata. Ela se chama Mika.
Uso muitos post-its ao longo do dia para registrar meus pensamentos.
Product Working Session
Bom, já é meio-dia
e estou entrando na sessão de trabalho de design.
Se você lembra da minha agenda de mais cedo,
aqui é onde trabalhamos
em qualquer requerimento essencial, prioridades.
É onde lidamos com os desafios dos problemas
que temos no design com os nossos gerentes de produtos
e alguns dos principais engenheiros.
Esta é uma ótima reunião muitifuncional em que todos nós podemos nos reunir
com os diferentes participantes da equipe.
Nesta reunião específica, estavamos vendo a apresentação na qual estamos trabalhando
e conferindo com outros funcionários para ter certeza
de que todos estão bem informados
sobre o que a equipe de design está fazendo.
Estas reuniões podem demorar.
Neste caso, durou uma hora.
Na maior parte das vezes, eu só escuto.
Às vezes, falo algo quando sinto que é necessário,
se quero clarificar algo, se tenho uma pergunta,
se sou chamada para esclarecer algo ou explicar algo sobre o design.
Se esta reunião fosse no escritório, meu laptop estaria fechado
e estaria prestando total atenção à discussão,
mas já que tenho trabalhado de casa, tenho feito mais coisas ao mesmo tempo.
durante este tipo de reunião, eu faço um pouco de trabalho leve
ao mesmo tempo.
Bom, acabei a verificação
e agora tenho que entrar em outra reunião,
mas são 13h e estou com fome.
Então, vou rapidamente pegar o almoço e me atrasar para a próxima reunião.
Fazer o que...
Lunch + Design Prioritisation Session
Trabalhar de casa significa almoçar o que sobrou do jantar.
Acho que isto era frango ao curry, talvez com arroz
que eu esquentei bem rápido
e voltei para minha mesa para não entrar na reunião muito tarde.
Esta é uma reunião externa
que temos com um fornecedor com quem estamos trabalhando.
Dá para ver um pouco do quadro do Trello que estamos usando com eles
para assegurar que nossos requerimentos são prioritizados apropriadamente
no trabalho deles.
No momento, estamos vendo uma lista de recursos futuros
e falando quais...
são as prioridades
e o que levamos em consideração quando priorizamos estes recursos.
Quick walk + talk
Aquela reunião acabou 30 minutos mais cedo,
então tenho...
de 20 a 30 minutos até a minha próxima reunião.
Pensei em vir aqui fora, caminhar um pouco
e sentir um pouco de ar puro antes de voltar
para outra reunião no resto da tarde.
Uma coisa que quero comentar e que você já deve ter notado
é que ser uma designer de produtos não significar passar o dia no Figma
desenhando pixels.
Apesar de isso ser uma grande parte do meu trabalho,
não é o que eu faço 8 horas por dia.
Há muitas reuniões,
conversamos muito para alinhar e definir prioridades,
para trabalharmos juntos em uma visão,
para entender a estratégia.
Muito do meu trabalho como designer é participar disso tudo.
Pelo resto do dia, depois desta reunião, quero me focar no controle de qualidade.
No projeto no qual estou trabalhando, engenheiros têm construido
os designs que criei.
Eles estão em uma etapa em que estão prontos para feedback
sobre a implementação.
Então, farei algumas capturas de tela
do progresso deles e em que etapa estão
e, dentro do Figma, farei uma comparação lado a lado
do que eles fizeram com o meu design e darei um feedback
sobre correções e mudanças a serem feitas.
Portanto, neste momento na verdade não estou fazendo o design de nada novo,
apesar de ter trabalhado em um conceito pela manhã.
Mas, esta é a vida real de uma designer.
Alguns dias você trabalha em coisas novas, em outros, não.
Bom, voltei bem na hora da reunião CP4.
Checkpoint 4 Meeting
A equipe de design geralmente lidera os Checkpoints 2 e 3.
Neste caso, o Checkpoint 4 é geralmente liderado pelos engenheiros
e pela equipe de operações de produtos.
Então, não apresentei nada nesta reunião
já que os designs tinham sido apresentados no último Checkpoint.
Por isso, acabei escutando mais,
conferindo o que está nos planos de lançamento
e qual seria o nosso cronograma de lançamento.
Bom, acabaram todas as minhas reuniões de hoje
Design QA'ing
e tenho o resto do dia para focar e ser produtiva.
Tento o máximo possível criar esses períodos de foco
onde eu posso me dedicar ao trabalho de design.
Considerando que já é a metade da tarde,
provavelmente não conseguirei entrar em um estado de foco zen hoje.
Eu faço isso melhor pela manhã.
Ainda há algo que quero fazer hoje que eu já mencionei,
que é fazer o controle de qualidade do progresso que os engenheiros fizeram
nos meus designs.
Então, acho que agora vou abrir o ambiente de demonstração,
fazer várias capturas de tela e botá-las no Figma
ao lado dos meus designs e destacar as áreas que precisam ser trabalhadas
e ajeitadas.
Então, vamos nessa.
Bom, gastei as 2 horas seguintes fazendo o controle de qualidade
do progresso dos engenheiros no design que entreguei para eles
na semana anterior.
Então, minhas pernas estavam começando a formigar.
No escritório, minha mesa fica sempre na posição em pé
e eu me apoio em uma banqueta.
Esta é uma clássica...
Na verdade, uma mesa de manivela bem ruim.
Funciona, mas...
Bom, minha perna estava formingando.
Agora que estou tentando me focar, ficar de pé me ajudará.
É... Bom. Fiquei com fome.
Não deixe de conferir no meu canal
um vídeo sobre meu processo de controle de qualidade com engenheiros,
mas basicamente estou conferindo se implementaram o design perfeitamente.
Quando estou trabalhando, tendo a ir e vir entre o Figma e minha agenda
para ter a certeza de que estou em dia
e também confiro o slack e meu e-mail, para não deixar de ver nenhuma novidade
dos meus colegas e para manter contato com quem está colaborando comigo.
Se quiser saber sobre a organização desta mesa na qual trabalho em casa,
fiz um vídeo só sobre as diferentes coisas e aparelhos que estou usando
enquanto trabalho de casa.
Se tiver interesse, confira o link na descrição.
End of day wrap up
Oi, amigo/a. Chegamos ao fim do dia de trabalho.
Passei as últimas horas
fazendo o controle de qualidade que queria fazer
e a última hora, mais ou menos, organizando o meu inbox.
Era uma dessas pequenas tarefas
que estava há tempos na minha lista mental de coisas para fazer.
Também conversei com gente da equipe.
Fiz algumas coisas diferentes ao fim do dia.
Bom, no geral, foi um dia bem agitado.
Geralmente tenho cerca de 3 a 4 horas de reuniões por dia.
Hoje foi um bom exemplo.
Se eu olhar minha agenda para amanhã...
Amanhã tenho mais tempo livre.
Há uma sessão de controle de qualidade de demostração com os engenheiros.
Eles vão fazer uma demostração do que estão construindo.
Estou ansiosa para isso, pois também posso mostrar
o trabalho de controle de qualidade que fiz hoje
e também espero que possamos discutir um plano
de como lidar e trazer para dentro do escopo
este trabalho para aplicá-lo e atualiar a UI.
Então, esta foi uma visão bastante real e transparente de como é meu dia a dia
sendo designer de produtos.
Perdão por não poder mostrar
os designs e conceitos nos quais estou trabalhando.
É por razões óbvias,
mas espero ter dado uma visão geral para que entenda como é o meu dia a dia.
Se pensa em ser um/a designer de produtos
espero que este vídeo o/a tenha inspirado
e animado quanto a como pode ser o seu dia a dia.
Se você já um/a designer, adoraria saber sobre como é o seu dia,
o que você faz de diferente.
Principalmente, quero dicas de como você planeja e estrutura o seu dia,
pois, como você viu aqui, eu não sou do tipo que planeja muito.
Me conta nos comentários.
Obrigada por assistir, não deixe de conferir meus outros vídeos
sobre design e pesquisa.
Tenha um ótimo dia!
Tchau!

# Agile Team Structure: Backend Software Engineer


Now that we have reviewed all the product-facing roles, let’s start with the common development-focused roles in an agile team, starting with the Backend Software Engineer. A BE Software engineer is mostly responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining the server-side logic, and databases of a software application. The following are the most common tasks performed by a BE engineer or developer within an agile team.

Collaborating with product manager/owner and development team: They work closely with the PM and development team to understand the requirements of the software application and make sure that the architecture of the platform or app they’re building meets those requirements.
Developing server-side/back-end logic: They’re primarily responsible for maintaining the logic that’s responsible for processing and storage of data. This logic usually sits on the server side of an application. They may work in programming languages such as Java, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.
Designing databases: They’re also responsible for designing a database’s architecture to support a certain application’s storage of data. This may entail working with databases such as MySQL or MongoDB. P.S. These are two distinct types of databases. MySQL is a relational database, while MongoDB is a non-relational database. Learn more about their differences below.
Writing and Maintaining APIs: An API, an abbreviation for Application Programming Interface, is a middleman that lies between an application’s front end and the back end. To explain it easily, we have to use a popular analogy. The API is like your local waiter or waitress at your popular restaurant. When you enter the restaurant, you don’t just get into the restaurant’s kitchen to make or serve your own food. You sit at a table and wait for the waiter or waitress to take your order. The waiter or waitress then goes into the kitchen to fetch the food you requested. Similarly, when you use an app or a website, you don’t go into the backend system and retrieve the data you need; you send a request to the API (your middleman/waitress/waiter). The API then fetches the data you need, which could be anything ranging from a list of users, products, followers, etc. and brings it to you in the front end of an application. Think of it this way: the API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software systems to talk to each other. It enables different software systems to communicate and share information. So, when you use an app or a website, you’re actually using the API to retrieve the data you need.
The video below highlights some of the things that a backend developer does. You will like this specific video resource because it also speaks about grey areas such as work-life balance as well as culture. Enjoy!

[Music]
the main attraction to coaches was the
the scale and scope of work they were
doing dealing with some really like
interesting problems simple things that
proved really powerful tools I'm Neil
um I'm head of development at Proctors
I joined Proctors as a senior developer
focused on backender applications so in
my role it's a lot about
mentorship architecture the systems sort
of clients about there that needs
understanding them so we can best
build solutions for them we use two
Frameworks mostly Drupal and Symphony in
the development part department we've
got back-end developers front-end
developers and also the QA team
What is a BackEnd Developer
what is a back-end developer the front
end is about the presentation layer of
data and like that interaction and the
back end's about building that data
having an interface to create it and
then communicating that to the front end
or you know other services as back-end
developers we do a lot of
troubleshooting and problem solving
there's obviously a lot of code it's
also knowledge and utilization of AWS we
create websites microservices apis we
design developer Architects we also do a
lot of Maintenance of those applications
ongoing past their go live so initially
we'll
uh work towards this this product to
start off with and then we'll have
different phases of work after it to do
different features Improvement
requirements that we've already set or
maybe knowledge that we learn from
building the first round of development
there's the support side of it as well
where there might be issues that are
raised in production with like older
systems that we have to react to and
address
How Neil started his career
when I was at College I realized I was
quite interested in computers such as a
broad spectrum of uh Computing as well
as like the design of systems moved into
a marketing agency where we're doing
small sites had more of an interest in
the system side of it so it came to
Proctors anyone that knows me around
here if you say apis then I'm there
straight away what are you talking about
I joined as a senior developer and then
became a principal architect focused on
Integrations apis microservices then it
became a application lead for the back
end team so it was started focusing on
mentoring and you know one-to-ones and
more focus on helping people uh progress
themselves now I've become head of
development helping the wider process
The Wider efficiencies of the team
the main attraction to policies was the
scale and scope of work they were doing
dealing with some really like
interesting problems got a bit of a
thing about like data and apis and
things I like to visualize that coming
through and how how that can impact and
how good solid understanding of problems
and how to efficiently and like simply
to solve them simple things that prove
really powerful tools gives me quite a
lot of pride in my work when you
understand the tooling you've gotten the
problem you can step away from it and
you can see how you can make it much
more efficient one thing I was working
on recently is this kind of longer
running process we had to perform it
offline locally so that we can scale up
the amount of memory we're using to do
it nothing too crazy just to get report
and I managed to get it down from like
10 20 30 minutes running to like 20
seconds it's a more useful tool rather
than like this effort to get this data
out of it
Clients
I've doubled in most of the clients that
we've had but of over the years have
mostly been focused on Panasonic like
the European teams and the the Japanese
teams acrosman Clark make me a help to
have to take that solution helped build
it help the team finalize it and
recently a little bit of UK chill
PSD
we have built
um kind of of our own seamless
microservice for the PSD it's really
powerful and able to serve websites live
and it has been doing that for a couple
of years in production in our Legacy
systems we had we had this API that
basically gave you the same data after
all the product data or the media data
and how to use it you know the control
of that information it was really slow
the old system you couldn't really use
it live you had to take a replication of
that data in any of the the systems that
were using it until we tore down that
idea of architect to the microservice
with different storage mechanisms in it
which now is industry quality and Lead
tooling and we're on boarding more
vendors to that service as well it's
nice to be able to you know fine tune
that system as well to tailor it better
to people a lot of people about purely
Culture
about culture you know and some people
are purely about you know what touring
they're going to be using what what
exposure they're going to get to like
big big problems or big client bases
Cottages have all of those things so
we're doing a lot of AWS work now so we
can
move
some of these chunky processes into
serverless architectures we're also you
know continually working on our uh like
culture the ethos of how we go about
work the values that drive us to do the
work we do how do we Define what's good
how do we Define what's complete how
could we best use our clients resources
to be able to you know give them the
best value we're continually working on
each aspect
Resources
approximately we've really got a really
diverse set of people we have recruited
from like code schools and as well we've
um we've got um two Juniors so we don't
really have a base Baseline they must
have this and that what what we really
want from people that are joining the
company uh like in aptitude for being
able to solve problems there's you know
a lot of support here for people that
are you know working through problems
you know I'll go talk to people to help
me with things we've got a lot of
knowledge that we can all draw on and
everyone's makes themselves available
for that so it's it's really helpful
when you're trying to learn particular
things and that may be development or
trying to learn development or maybe I'm
trying to use this learn this tool that
I haven't used before but I know someone
else has I mean we do launch and learns
where people just talk about topics that
are you know pertinent to them in their
lives and you know it's a good
opportunity for us to learn something
we've got a good culture in that kind of
support which I think is pretty powerful
and it's something we can build on and
keep making use of it's actually working
Worklife balance
for me is a really good thing that
allows me to be able to dedicate a bit
more of my time to my family so that
work at half seven you get a load of
you know set up in my own mind as
helping Joe's going to go get get ready
you know get clear awesome to-do lists
and things like that and then I couldn't
finish early it means I've got a bit
more quality time with my family I've
got two small children a six and four if
I was to get home at half six half seven
then I'm seeing them at their worst and
they're seeing me at their worst so if
if I'm finishing you know mid-afternoon
up maybe got a little bit more energy to
give them every Wednesday so we have a
collaborative gaming session which any
anyone's welcome to taking it out a bit
of their frustrations on Mario cat on
occasion like the the schedule is
somewhat loose but um all the tech
department get together and go for a
night out an activity or it might just
be you know some quiet afternoon
beverages or evening beverages I think
one of the the bigger ones we did
recently was ax throwing in Bristol
which was eventful so everyone got
behind that literally no one was named
which was the highlight
I have to do what I I have to clap
you're not going to give me
pronunciation and allocution lessons
I've got one worse than you and then I
moved down South for me um
what's that what's that what do you
think for your food
from your sins from it then I moved down
south before my sins what got you to
where you are and today outcraft
is that sound
[Music]
oh I made Winchester
and I haven't been told off about it yet
so you know people must appreciate it
yeah
just block block me video Newton down 10
minutes you can come back in

# Agile Team Structure: Frontend Software Engineer


Every piece of software is usually a combination of backend and frontend components. This is why a Front-end Software Engineer is another important member of the agile product development team. Frontend Developers/Engineers are responsible for developing user interfaces for software applications. They collaborate with Product Designers or UI/UX Designers and product managers to ensure that the implementation of user interfaces is in line with the design requirements. They also collaborate with backend developers to make sure that _API _endpoints they need to hook their frontends to the backends are provided. Remember our waiter/waitress analogy? The following are tasks that a FE software engineer might perform on a day to day.

Participating in sprint planning meetings to understand the requirements for what’s being worked on during the sprint.
Collaborating with designers to make sure that UI mockups are feasible and can be implemented within the software development constraints.
Testing and debugging platform frontends/user interfaces to ensure they work as expected and are bug-free. A bug is an unexpected problem within a hardware or software system. For example, a bug might be an error that causes you to get logged out of a certain application after four seconds.
Integrating the front end with the back end of the application, working closely with backend developers to ensure a seamless experience for the end-user.
Participating in daily stand-up meetings to provide updates on the status of their work and raise any issues or concerns.
This short video gives a run-down of what front-end developers do on a daily basis. It covers concepts such as:

HTML is the core language of the web.
CSS which is used to make our websites or web apps pretty!
JavaScriptwhich enables interactivity in a web application.
Don’t worry, you’ll cover these languages and technologies further on in your core learning paths! As you watch the video below, ask yourself the following questions:

What does a frontend engineer do?
What technology stacks does a frontend engineer use?
How does the role of a frontend engineer fit into the larger product development process?

If you’re interested in learning more, feel free to go watch another Video by SuperSimpleDev, who has explained front end engineering through the product lens!

what's up everybody how's it going in
this video we're going to cover
everything that you need to know that
front-end engineering what it is exactly
how hard it is and whether or not you
should do it so sit back relax be on the
lookout for when you're gonna want to
smash the like button in this video and
let's dive into it one thing to clarify
here when I talk about front-end
engineering I'm specifically referring
to web development or the type of
engineering that uses the same tech
stack that you would use in web
development like javascript CSS HTML so
I'm not necessarily referring to mobile
development using swift or Objective C
for instance web development ok so let's
Frontend Engineering
start by looking at what front-end
engineering really is because there are
a lot of misconceptions about it out
there especially if you ask back-end
engineers or engineers who've never
worked on the front-end they tend to
butcher it or to tell you things that
aren't super accurate so I will give you
a clear picture of it I like to define
front-end engineering by splitting it up
into four broad categories of work that
you're likely gonna do at one point in
your life if you're a front-end engineer
keep in mind these are broad categories
so I might not be capturing every single
piece of front-end engineering work that
exists out there but hopefully these
categories are broad enough such that
they can encapsulate everything the
first category is styling CSS the thing
that we all know and hate okay maybe I
am the only one who hates it I can't be
the only one who hates it
CSS styling is admittedly a large part
of front-end engineering now here's
where things get interesting though and
this is where I've very much surprised a
lot of people in the past when I've told
them that when I was a front-end
engineer at Google as effectively a
front-end engineer because I worked
purely on the front-end for my two years
and two months there I never wrote a
single line of CSS during those two
years or maybe I wrote like five lines
at most how is that possible I bet a lot
CSS
of you in the comments are going to be
very surprised it's possible because
depending on the type of project that
you're working on you
may not need to write CSS the reason I
didn't write CSS at Google is because I
worked on the Google cloud platform UI
and if you've ever seen the Google cloud
platform UI specifically the Google
cloud platform console you've likely
noticed that the UI is for all the
different Google cloud platform products
look very very similar and that's done
on purpose because Google wants the
Google cloud platform to be very
homogeneous and to look like it's
basically a single suite of products not
a bunch of products that happen to be on
the same platform and so they want
everything to look the same they want
all the buttons all the tables all the
lists all the drop-down menus everything
to look the same to look very cohesive
and so what that meant was that as a
front-end engineer I wasn't actually
responsible for styling any of the stuff
that I was putting on the page I was
given these pre-made
puzzle pieces so to speak that I just
had to put together and wire up add some
logic into them to make them perform now
of course this is in stark contrast with
a type of front-end engineering work
that we do on algo expert for example by
the way if you're preparing for your
coding interviews or your systems design
interviews check out algo expert yo my
company use it from a code Klebsiella am
for a discount on the platform but so on
algo expert since we created the entire
website from scratch we weren't given
these pre-made puzzle pieces we had to
do a lot of styling we had to do the
entire styling on the website so we
wrote and we continued to write a lot of
CSS on algo expert and by the way there
are a lot of different levels or degrees
of CSS this applies to all aspects of
software engineering but particularly so
to CSS you can do basic styling the kind
of styling that you need to have a
proper presentable website and that's
just normal CSS but then you can do a
lot more advanced CSS if you want really
cool little animations or pieces of
artwork on a website so for instance
here I'll point to systems expert we've
got a few really cool animation
on the system's expert homepage and I'm
not gonna take credit for them it's the
other person who's working on the front
end who did that but the point is they
involve a lot more complex CSS they're
the types of projects that take a lot
more time you typically will treat them
as their own little featurettes and
that's just a next level of CSS above
just normal website styling the second
type of friend work is gonna be what I
like to call layout this is really gonna
be just HTML putting elements on a page
this is gonna get a little bit more
complicated once you start to work with
front-end frameworks like angular or
react because if your template in your
HTML is gonna be a little bit more
complex there might be a little bit of
framework specific stuff that you're
gonna add to it but the point is layout
is a very core part of front-end work
contrary to CSS I would say that no
matter what you work on you're gonna
have to do some bit of layout because at
the end of the day with front-end
engineering work you are putting stuff
State Management
on a page so it's very rare that you
would do front-end work with absolutely
no layout no HTML but the way that I
like to think about layout is it's
really just the glue that puts
everything together in front of
engineering then the third category of
work in front end engineering is what I
like to call state management and this
is where things start to get very tricky
this is something that I think a lot of
people who haven't worked on the front
end might not think about when they
think of the front end state management
is basically the way that you manage
State in your application if you're not
familiar with State if you think of a
web application at any given point in
time that web application is in a
particular state for example maybe a
drop-down menu is open maybe a credit
card is written in a purchase form may
be a question on algo expert is marked
as complete that is the state of the
application and you need to manage that
state how do you manage it by writing
JavaScript by using frameworks like
react and angular this is where you can
actually start to show off your skills
as a friend
Nehring by writing good code modular
components sensible state management
this is where things start to get much
more complicated and this is something
that like I said a lot of people either
aren't aware of or they take for granted
for example take a website like algo
expert in the top right corner we have
the little login text and if you're
logged in it says welcome and your
username this is the kind of thing where
a back-end engineer someone who's never
worked on the front-end might assume
that because if they see the username of
the user in the top right corner of the
screen there that anywhere on the page
you should have access to the username
you know they might think that oh that
username is up there so if we wanted to
we could display the username also
somewhere lower in the page not
necessarily depending on how you've
designed your application you might not
have access to that particular part of
the state meaning the username elsewhere
in your applications that makes sense if
you've worked on the front end you know
exactly what I'm talking about and I'm
hinting at stuff like Redux for instance
but if you've never worked on the front
end this might be very confusing to you
you might take this for granted think
wait what what do you mean you have the
username it's up there why can't you
like display it lower on the page well
because of state management and then
Synchronization
finally the fourth part of front-end
engineering is what I'm gonna call
dealing with a synchronicity when you're
writing a web application you are almost
certainly gonna be interacting with a
back-end with an API you're gonna be
making network requests these network
requests are gonna be asynchronous
meaning you're not gonna get the
responses from these requests instantly
and you're gonna have to deal with that
that can go from being very trivial you
just make one Network request you get a
response and you do something with it
too very complex because maybe you're
gonna be chaining five different network
requests maybe you're gonna have to
handle a bunch of different potential
responses a bunch of different errors
maybe you're gonna have to do some state
management within those responses to
these asynchronous actions the point is
dealing with asynchronous city in
JavaScript and in front-end engineering
is pervasive
gonna have to do it and it can get very
tricky it can get very complex and it's
also very fun this is the part of
front-end engineering that I enjoy the
most but so that's front-end engineering
in a nutshell
I would say that most engineers who work
on the front-end are gonna have to work
in all four of these categories or at
least they're gonna have to be
well-versed in these four categories but
depending on your situation
you may work a little bit more in one
category or the other for instance like
I said I just didn't do any styling when
I was a front-end engineer at Google
because of the product that I worked on
it's possible that you might do the
opposite as a front-end engineer maybe
you're gonna be working on a project
where you're focusing most of your
attention on CSS on styling on making a
really cool animations maybe going to
those really high levels of CSS and less
so on the asynchronous aspect of
front-end engineering or on the state
management aspect and of course if
you're dealing with a very static
website that doesn't really deal with an
API then you're gonna have a lot less of
that other stuff now how hard is
How hard is it
front-end engineering I would say that
it's relatively hard obviously the more
you practice it the more you do it the
easier it gets but I would say that it
tends to be underestimated or when
people say that it's very difficult they
might think it's difficult for the wrong
reasons for instance I think that now
it's very common to hear people
especially back-end engineers say things
like oh yes the front-end is very hard
so they'll concede that the front-end is
very hard they'll even say stuff like
front-end engineering is more difficult
than back in engineering but then
they'll justify it by saying because it
involves a lot of like art or UX design
because you're styling stuff and I think
that's misguided that's misinformed that
assumes that as a front-end engineering
not only are you gonna be doing styling
but that you might even be the person
deciding on what website looks like
which again might be true if you're
working on your own business like us on
algo expert where we come up with a UX
design but if you're at a big company
like Google you're certainly not gonna
be coming up with a UX design as a
front-end engineer so I think that's an
incorrect reason
for which front-end engineering would be
deemed hard what I think is more
accurate is that front-end engineering
is deceptively simple a UI looks easy to
build but it can actually be very tricky
to build behind the scenes the canonical
example is the saying I don't know if
it's a real saying but you often hear
people say it which is that oh it's just
a checkbox no you have a feature on the
UI that's a checkbox and someone will
say oh yeah that's just the checkbox or
you haven't implemented that feature yet
and they'll be like don't worry it's
just a checkbox but it turns out it's
not just a checkbox it's actually really
complicated we had a perfect example of
Google example
this at Google a few months before I
left we had this feature that our
back-end team had been working on and
they told us on the front-end they were
like oh don't worry about it this will
have very little UI ramification it's
just gonna be a checkbox literally they
said that it's just gonna be a checkbox
we were you know cautiously giving them
the benefit of the doubt but then it
turned out that that checkbox had so
much logic behind it because checking
off that checkbox had you issue some API
calls but in order to issue those API
calls you had to have like three
different permissions so we had to check
if the user had permission to check the
checkbox how do you set for permissions
you make API calls so we have to do like
three different API calls but then for
some of these API calls
there were prerequisite permissions that
you needed so we needed other API calls
this complicated a bunch of stuff and
there was error handling state
management oh but wait you need access
to this piece of information here but
we're not in the same part of the UI
where we typically have access to that
information point is it wasn't just a
check box it's never just a check box
front-end engineering is pretty hard and
that's that but then on the final note
as far as whether or not you should work
on the front-end I would really say that
it's a matter of personal preference I
personally love front-end engineering
even though I always like to joke that I
hate CSS so that I dislike CSS even CSS
can be fun I think
the package of those four categories of
work that I described is very rewarding
it's very challenging it's a good
mixture of different types of skills and
what I love the most about front-end
engineering work is that you can really
see visually so the outcome of your work
I'll give the example I'll go experts
putting aside the fact that with algo
expert were actually building our own
business but it was so rewarding and it
continues to be so rewarding to see all
this work that you put into the code
suddenly turn into a website that people
can actually interact with that has
functionality that looks really good and
so on and so forth so that's why I love
front-end engineering that's why I think
a lot of people love from engineering
that's why I think you might love
front-end engineering if you're not
already into it let me know what you

# Agile Team Structure: Fullstack Software Engineer


Imagine you and your friends want to build a website for a school project. Each friend has a specific role: one designs how the website looks, another writes the code that makes it work, and another person handles the server where the website is hosted. A Fullstack Engineer is a person who can do a bit of everything and ensures the website is complete and functional.

Fullstack Engineers use their skills to build a website from start to finish. They work on the front end by creating the visual elements and making sure they look good and are easy to use. They also write the code that makes the buttons work, the forms that collect information from a user, and ensure the pages navigate smoothly.

Full-stack engineers are responsible for developing both the frontend and backend components of a software product. They are more common in startup companies where engineers typically work on problems outside of their core domain areas. Mid-size to large multinationals typically hire engineers who specialize in different domains largely because they have the resources to do so.

In the short and sweet video below, we’re going to look at what Fullstack Engineers do. Pay close attention to:

The front end of a website is also known as the client side.
The back end is also known as the server side.
You need to know how the internet works in-depth to be a strong engineer.
What do you enjoy the most about Fullstack Development? Is it a career path you see yourself in? What don’t you like about it?

wanted to help a lot of you new
developers out with is understanding
what is
full stack development so maybe you want
to be a full stack developer maybe
you've heard of this term full stack
development
you're like what the heck is it i've
heard it's like front end and back end
how much do you
know i really just want to cover the
basics here so you have a good
foundation moving forward so without any
further ado
let's dive into it now look in order to
understand what
full stack development is it's really
good to have a basic understanding of
what a web
application is so and when i say a web
application what i mean is let's let's
say you go to youtube.com
Web Applications
in your browser many of you probably
think of youtube.com
and youtube in general as a website
right like i put that in my browser that
is a website but in truth something like
youtube where there's literally billions
of hours of content stored somewhere
that's not on your computer obviously
that's accessible within milliseconds
that's an entire system that you're not
seeing so
just keep in mind that when we talk
about full stack development we're
talking about web applications which are
mostly what you interact with on the
internet so say you go to youtube.com
what is full stack development in
relation to a web app so web app has
two major components to it that you may
have heard about right so you've heard
about
the front end so when you go to that
link in your browser that is what you're
viewing you are viewing the front end
which
is the user interface right it's also
called
client side or client-side code now
if you start to learn to code that's
where you have learned html css and
javascript that's where that comes into
play where you know wherever the user
interacts with that's the front end now
that's nice that's pretty but that's
really just the tip of the iceberg in
terms of having youtube be functional
and having those
billions or even probably trillions of
hours of
video that's available to you and what
helps support that
is the back end or also what's known as
Server Side Code
server-side code so
when you request a video when you
clicked on my video here that was the
website that you clicked on but the
website needed
the actual data right the actual bits
the ones and zeros that compromised
my video in order to get that it had to
go to some remote server in a remote
location and say okay i want andy's
video
give me that information and it's
probably a couple gigabit worth of
information so it's a lot
so it had to be transported over the
internet the thing that handled all that
the server
is what you call the back end and that
encompasses the web server that's
serving that information that
encompasses the database that
houses that video that you were looking
for so
the way i like to explain this to people
there's a front end and there's a back
Front End Back End
end
now why do we call like what is where
does full stack come in here
so full stack developer or full stack
development really refers to
a developer who is proficient in both
the front end and the back end
so that means that they can write code
for the user interface they can
update the look and feel of the
application but they also have
skills that they could work in the back
end so they can work with the api they
can update the api
they can add endpoints they can change
things in the database they have the
proficiency and skill
anywhere in between those two things
they have enough knowledge to make it
work now
there is no flat definition for what is
required as far as a skill set in fact
the term full stack software developer
is very controversial in the field
because some people say it's a made up
term it's a buzz word and i'm not going
to get into
what i believe it's here to stay as far
as i can tell
but um one last thing i would say about
full stack development in case it
doesn't really make a whole lot of sense
the reason we call it full stack is
because if you were to lay out the front
and the back end and all the different
components that are involved
it would look like a stack of pancakes
right like each part would sort of it
would start at the very top and go to
the bottom so
at the very top would be like what is
runs on your browser so your html css
and javascript
now that's pretty much all that really
i'd say is involved in the front end
below that you have the internet so you
have to have pretty good knowledge of
the internet which means that you have
to know how it works how
the front end connects with the back end
um and then from there as far as the
actual back end goes there's
many more pancakes there right so you've
got like your api you've got your web
server you've got your database
you've got the operating system that the
database or the server is running on so
somebody who would consider themselves
or who is called
full stack developer would have
proficiency of skills throughout the
stack doesn't mean they know everything
in an expert level i don't really think
that's possible
but again it's not something i will get
it to into this video we'll get into
that in future videos actually
so yeah that's pretty much it i guess um
i hope that you have enjoyed this video
i hope it gives you some more
information
by the way if you have enjoyed the video
i do ask you to leave a like hit the
subscribe button as well if you want
more content from me
and also by the way if you are looking
to become a full stack web developer and
you are serious and you're committed to
it you're not just uh
half heartedly committed right i have a
mentorship program for those of you guys
who are interested i will leave a link
in the description below so you can get
more information about how to
potentially
join if it makes sense other than that
thank you so much for watching and
peace out as always everybody

# Agile Team Structure: Mobile Software Engineer
![alt text](image-7.png)

The development of Facebook which you can use on your desktop web browser, is completely different from the development of the Facebook app on your phone. Mobile software engineers are the ones who design, develop, and maintain that app. They write the code that makes the app do all the cool things it can do.

Mobile software engineers are experts in programming languages like Swift (for iOS) or Java/Kotlin (for Android). They use these languages to write the code that makes the app work. They create the buttons, screens, animations, and everything else that you see and interact with within the app.

The video below shows what mobile Software Engineers do on a daily basis. It’s also an inspirational short video! Enjoy, and as you watch the video ask yourself the following questions:

What do Mobile Software Developers do?
What kind of technology stacks do Mobile Software Developers use?
Is this the kind of role you want to take up as a career?

When I was growing up my parents
wanted me to become a medical doctor.
I was opened to a world of programming,
I had to go with my own choice.
I've always been curious at how tech
works ever since I was a young boy.
I was introduced to web development,
then I picked up Android development.
Being able to create my app and share it
and showcase it was fascinating.
I just started creating my own apps.
I came across a program by the Andela Learning Community
in collaboration with Google Africa.
I was fortunate to be a part of it.
I moved to Dusseldorf in 2020.
It's been quite an interesting ride.
I'm adapting as time goes.
I enrolled in the Udacity Android Nanodegree Scholarship.
I will say it was actually a game changer for me.
My network of professional Android developers grew.
I was able to complete
my Nanodegree program.
After learning I was able to secure a job
and I posted my certificate on Twitter.
That's how my employer located me.
I went through a series of interviews.
I took coding tests where I
developed an Android application.
The only language I'd ever written was Java.
I had to learn Kotlin on the fly because I wanted the job.
I only took two days to write the assignment in Kotlin.
Kotlin is so fluid, easy to use, and has a lot
of resources for learning outside here including
YouTube videos, blog posts from the Android community.
Now I'm an engineer at Kudi.
Building softwares, helping the Nigerian economy.
I made my dream a reality.
I'm an Android engineer at Trivago.
About 95% of the the Trivago app is written in Kotlin.
We write less boilerplate code, the code is more concise.
Extension functions, named parameters which gives us
some form of flexibility in our architecture.
I'm in the early part of my career.
I look forward to obtaining a master's degree
in software engineering so I can build
more useful software for people
and make their life easier.
For the future, eventually I'd love to settle down.
Starting out a business, there's a lot to be done.
I have the passion for education
and one of the ways through which I can
achieve this is through technology.
My family, they're excited and proud about
the progress I'm making in the tech space.
I believe helping people moreso
in the tech space is something
that really gives you an upper hand.
Especially when you're new in the industry.
Android development did provide me
a lot of opportunities.
I've had the chance to talk to people
from Nigeria, Morocco, people in the US,
people in Germany, Philippines.
Through Android development
I've met like-minded people and formed
a tech family where we've had conversations
that are life changing and career transforming.
Technology feels like
one language which we all understand
and I can say that's really mind-blowing.

# Agile Team Structure: Cloud DevOps Engineer
![alt text](image-8.png)

Imagine you have a big team of friends who are building a huge LEGO city together. Each friend has their own special LEGO pieces and tasks, like building houses, roads, and bridges. A DevOps engineer is like the person who makes sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently in the LEGO city. First, the DevOps engineer helps the team by setting up systems and tools to make the building process easier. They make sure everyone has the right LEGO pieces, like distributing them to the right builders and blocks at the right time. They also create a plan for how all the different pieces will fit together and work as a complete city.

Next, the DevOps engineer focuses on automation. This means they find ways to make repetitive tasks in the LEGO city automated, just like using machines to do things faster and with fewer mistakes. For example, they might build a machine that can automatically place LEGO bricks in a specific order for a building, saving time and effort for the builders.

The DevOps engineer also keeps an eye on the LEGO city’s performance and stability. They monitor if there are any issues, like a bridge that’s not strong enough or a road that’s not wide enough for the LEGO cars. They fix these problems quickly so that the builders can continue their work smoothly.

Brilliant analogy aside, DevOps Engineers ensure that software development and delivery processes are streamlined, efficient, and of high quality. They focus on automating and improving the integration, testing, and deployment of software which allows teams to move faster while maintaining quality and reliability. Some common daily tasks Dev-ops engineers do include:

Development and maintenance of tools, scripts, and systems that automate software deployment, testing, and monitoring. Manage and configure cloud infrastructure such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), to ensure that applications can scale and are resilient to failures.
Setting up and maintaining continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
Participating in sprint planning meetings to ensure alignment with development teams that DevOps requirements are incorporated into the development process.
The video below shows what DevOps engineers work on. Note that this is going to be very related to the AWS Cloud Practitioner path you’re going to be taking later in the course. What do you think is the most exciting thing about being a DevOps engineer?

A question for you: Is Cloud DevOps engineering the kind of role you see yourself fulfilling in the future?

Intro
[Music]
we will discuss the role of the DevOps
engineer and how you can step up in your
present role to become a DevOps engineer
we'll also see the ongoing trend in need
for organizations to move to DevOps
so who exactly is a DevOps engineer
DevOps engineer is a new role that
software organizations are creating
within organizations that are adopting
DevOps and the various tools within the
DevOps toolkit those organizations need
professionals who know and understand
these tools DevOps engineers work with
various tools to implement continuous
integration and continuous deployment
familiarity with tools like git Jenkins
teamcity puppet Chef ansible kubernetes
Amazon AWS cloud cucumber sonar Nagios
to name a few can catapult your journey
to become a DevOps engineer so why do we
Why We Need DevOps Engineers
need DevOps Engineers organizations that
are using DevOps are overwhelmingly
high-functioning they deploy code 30
times faster and 30 times more
frequently and 50% fewer of their
deployments fail after they began using
DevOps software isn't written the old
way anymore where it used to be written
from scratch which is a highly complex
time-consuming process creating new
DevOps Software
software products now is often a matter
of choosing the right open source
software and bringing them together
while writing some code the complexity
of today's software lies less in writing
the code and more in ensuring that the
new software will work across a range of
operating systems and platforms right
away similarly builds testing
Build Testing
deployments are now done much more
frequently and that is possible only if
developers communicate early and
regularly with the operations teams and
the operations team in turn brings their
knowledge of the production environment
to design and testing stages of the
software project what kind of skills
DevOps Engineer Skills
does the DevOps engineer need you need
soft skills a very broad understanding
of tools and technologies software and
infrastructure security infrastructure
automation tools and also testing you
need your customer comes first mindset
you also need skills such as
collaboration flexibility awareness of
the network and of course to be able to
think and see the big picture for a
DevOps Engineer Communication
DevOps engineer to be successful you
must possess strong communication skills
similar to agile development teams soft
skills are incredibly important not just
for the individual engineer but also in
making the organizational cultural shift
to implementing and then standardizing
DevOps since new technologies and tools
DevOps Engineer Knowledge
continuously crop up on the DevOps
landscape it's highly important for a
good DevOps engineer to have a broad
understanding of those in the following
areas the source control like git
bitbucket subversion continuous
integration like jenkins bamboo vs TS
infrastructure automation like puppet
container concepts like docker
deployment automation or orchestration
like jenkins octopus deploy container
concepts like lv XD or docker
orchestration like kubernetes me soz
swarm cloud like AWS asher Google cloud
and OpenStack a great DevOps engineer is
always curious and open to learning new
things he or she must constantly ask
questions and then listen to answers to
generate new ideas and welcome new
challenges while combining development
and operations is a great way to
streamline development and deployment of
code the faster cycle means that
vulnerabilities can be introduced into
code much faster than previously
therefore DevOps engineers must be able
to write secure code to protect
applications from attack as well as
defend against common cyber security
vulnerabilities DevOps professionals
even though they don't need to be expert
security professionals can benefit
tremendously from having software
security training as in so many tech
DevOps Engineer Automation
environments a key element of DevOps is
automation a lot of the manual tasks
performed by more traditional system
administrators and engineering roles can
be automated by using scripting
languages like Python Ruby bash shell
and nodejs
this will ensure consistent performance
of manual tasks by removing the human
component and allowing teams to spend
and save time on more of the broader
goals of the team and the company so the
DevOps engineer
possess the ability to use automation
technology and tools at any level from
requirements to development to testing
and all the way to operations automation
DevOps Engineer Testing
is driven by testing so strong testing
skills are needed to be a successful
DevOps engineer when proper tests are in
place you can rest assured that each
function is doing what it was written to
do from all stages from development to
deployment you can run tests to make
sure that the entire system is
interacting and it has all the new
features now first and foremost the
DevOps engineer always cares about
delivering value to his or her customers
and wants to understand and measure how
the work is moving the needle while
DevOps engineers are not typically
external facing roles developers QA
customer success project management
business leaders are all their clients
by caring about the outcome as opposed
to their part of the supply chain
they'll have the right instincts with
regard to how to optimize for end-to-end
success strong DevOps managers must be
DevOps Engineer Teamwork
great team members and help relieve
bottlenecks by assisting co-workers as
necessary any problem in the project is
everyone's problem and a great engineer
always makes those around them better a
great DevOps engineer works in small
batches so that the others can do their
work more easily from performing code
reviews to writing acceptance tests the
key basically is to have empathy for
others so that the entire team can move
more quickly
a successful DevOps culture demands
DevOps Engineer Flexibility
flexibility multitasking is another key
for a DevOps engineer the DevOps
DevOps Engineer Multitasking
engineer must be network aware the end
objective of any DevOps project is to be
able to successfully deliver an
application to the end user who will
consume it and use it that involves the
network a good DevOps engineer will
recognize that you have to account for
the network in your to design your
planning and your testing while many
DevOps engineers are excellent software
engineers they sometimes lack the
ability to look at the big picture and
identify what makes sense for the client
Big Picture
because DevOps combines the needs and
wants of multidisciplinary teams and
applications a successful DevOps
engineer can't lose sight of the big
picture for DevOps and digital
transformation at the enterprise level
especially in a large organization now
this helps avoid creating contention
points and constraints that can carry
from one project to another so our
DevOps Engineer Roles
DevOps engineers a new team within
organizations a DevOps engineer
basically can be anyone who has had
software development or software
deployment production monitoring
knowledge and is also adept with newer
automation tools it can be a Java
developer who knows how to work at
Jenkins pipeline to create automated
builds using maven it's a manual tester
who writes TDD test cases forge a unit
or configures sonar quality gates for
software delivery it can be a systems
operations engineer who understands the
architecture of a software and helps the
team set up a performance test suite for
testing in summary it's a software
professional who understands all aspects
of software development and delivery
whether its system architecture
deployment pipelines or instance
management DevOps engineers came in at
DevOps Engineer Salary
number three on various job portals in
America in 2017 the DevOps engineer
position grew by a 106 percent in the
last few years and the DevOps engineer
position boasts an annual salary of one
hundred twenty three thousand one
hundred sixty five dollars so that is
how much DevOps
Engineer jobs are in demand and how much
had they're expected to grow a survey of
252 Gartner research circle members
showed that 38% of those were already
using DevOps in 2016 and an additional
35% have plans to implement DevOps in
2017 that is over 70% of the world's
entire IT market we are talking about
and the Gartner and State of DevOps
Subscribe
report for 2017 summarizes it all for us
saying that by 2020 half of the CIOs of

# Agile Team Structure: Data Analyst
![alt text](image-9.png)

You’ve gone through several roles that use data, or use analysis of data to determine their next steps. We saw how product owners, managers and UI/UX researchers use them. This use isn’t limited to product though. Sales often use data to adjust their strategies and figure out what’s working and what’s not. Operations make use of data to optimize their inner workings and become more efficient. Who do you think collects and analyses all this data? Well, it’s the Data Analyst!

First, the data analyst’s job is to collect the right information. This is something they figure out in collaboration with other team members. For example, if sales want to evaluate a new outreach strategy, the data analyst will work with them to figure out what is the best data to gather for that purpose. They then organize this information in a special way, like putting the data into groups, collating them and giving it a proper structure. Next, they start to analyze the data. This means they look at patterns and trends. They might notice certain abnormalities and run special analysis to confirm them. The point will always be to collect evidence to confirm something or make recommendations.

As you guessed, this is an oversimplification to get you all to understand what the role is about. The crux of the role is that data analysts collect, analyze, and _interpret _data to help organizations make informed decisions and solve problems.

Data analysts also use special tools and software to help them with their work. These tools make it easier for them to understand the data and find important information.

Once they have all this information, data analysts can help make decisions or give suggestions. For example, they might tell a sweet company that people really like red sweets, so they should make more of them. Or they might tell the sales team which of the two outreach strategies is working better, and which they should focus their effort on.

So, in simple terms, a data analyst is like a detective who collects and looks at information to find patterns and help make decisions. They use special tools to analyze the data and give suggestions based on what they discover.

In the video below, you’ll learn about what a data analyst tackles on a day-to-day basis. Pay close attention to the following pointers:

Data analysts use a host of different tools such as spreadsheet software, Structured Query Language (SQL), and programming languages such as Python, etc, to perform their analysis and visualization tasks in a team.
The ETL data analyst process stands for Extract, Transform, Load. What do you think each entails?

what's going on everybody my name is
alex freeberg and in today's video we're
gonna be talking about everything you
need to know about what a data analyst
actually does in their job day to day
we're also gonna be walking through
qualifications skills and the salary
that you can expect as a data analyst
Job Description
so let's start with the job description
and i'm gonna take you through each part
of what a data analyst actually does in
their job
and the very first part of that is
defining the problem the first thing
that you have to do is determine what
the client actually needs
do they need a dashboard do they need
reports do they need to do some type of
analysis on their product and give some
type of recommendation
and when you get that you have to create
a plan of action when are you getting
this data where is it coming from where
are you putting the data
and what are the time stream for all
these steps and often it can be your job
to communicate that to the team
the next thing that you want to do is
collect the data and data can come from
a ton
of different sources so whether that's a
sql backup a flat file or an api
or if they have all of those you have to
be able to get all that data into one
place
then you need to work with your
programmers to create an etl process
which means extract transform and load
so you're going to work with your
programmer to actually get the data and
then you're going to create business
rules to transform it
for how you actually want to look in
your system and then you actually have
to load the data
this can also be known as creating an
etl pipeline if you have data that's
going to be coming in either weekly or
monthly you don't want to have to do
this process manually every single time
and so creating a pipeline is going to
be creating an automated process to
bring that data in the same way every
single time
and that's going to save you a lot of
time every single time that you bring
that data into your system
and the very last thing is aggregating
your data which basically just means
standardizing your data and putting it
all together instead of having it as
separate sources
and the next thing that you'll do as a
data analyst is actually clean the data
and data is
always messy trust me i have seen just
about everything that you can imagine
they're using three different date
formats some people's names are
capitalized for absolutely no reason
and somebody forgot to add the customer
id so you can't actually map the patient
in your system
and you do all this because you want to
make the data a lot more usable for
later processes
and part of this is normalizing and
standardizing the data so that when you
do your visualizations or your reports
later
all the data looks the same that can be
used in any part that you need to be
used in
and the last part of this is data
validation which is basically just
quality assurance and you're looking
through your data and running queries on
your data to make sure that your data
looks how it's supposed to look
the next thing that you need to do is
set up your data for reports and
visualizations and
oftentimes you do this through creating
views a view allows you to combine
several tables into one and then choose
a subset of that data that you actually
want to use for your reports and
visualizations
and each view may need to be formatted
differently based on what you're going
to be using it for in the report or the
visualization
and for the very last thing you're
actually going to create your reports
and your visualizations
i know for myself i use sql for all my
reports so i like to automate that
process so that if a client wants it
every week or every month
i can just create a stored procedure or
a job that automatically sends that out
with the latest data
every single week or month you can also
connect that data to a data
visualization tool like tableau power bi
python or r
and lastly you just want to make sure
that your report visualization solves a
problem that you intended for it to
solve so it goes back to the very first
thing that we looked at which is
what does the client want what do they
need and so this step just makes sure
that that is actually resolved
next let's look at some of the
qualifications for a data analyst
oftentimes you are going to need a
bachelor's i haven't seen a lot of jobs
where they have not required a
bachelor's degree
so oftentimes as the minimum requirement
for you and often they want those
degrees to be in something like computer
science
statistics mathematics finance or
something like that
a master's degree may be required for
some positions it doesn't happen often
but i have seen some data analyst
positions that do require a master's
i don't think you need a bachelor's
degree in order to become a data analyst
but i think it definitely helps
especially when a lot of jobs require a
minimum of a bachelor's
Skills
next let's look at some of the skills
that data analysts actually use the
first one is sql
then we have r and python tableau power
bi which are our data visualization
tools
sas or spss excel and then some type of
cloud platform like aws
or azure now let's look at salary and
Salary
for an entry level job you can expect 45
to 60 thousand dollars
at mid level from 65 to 80 000 and then
for a senior level position anywhere
from 85 to 110 000
there definitely are a lot of things
that data analysts do and a lot of
things that you need to learn in order
to become a data analyst
but i will say that almost all these
things you can learn for free online or
for a very affordable price on things
like udemy or coursera or edx
and so there's so many options for
actually learning the skills that you
need to become a data analyst
and i highly recommend just looking into
it and seeing if this is something that
you're really interested in
i hope that helped you understand a
little bit more about what a data
analyst actually does in their job

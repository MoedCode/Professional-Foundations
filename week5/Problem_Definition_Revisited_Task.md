### **Title: Transportation Problem Reflection & Scoping**

---

### **1. Chosen GCGO and Problem Identified:**

**GCGO**: Infrastructure – Transportation for low-income workers in urban areas.

**Problem**: Low-income workers face challenges with affordable and reliable public transport options, impacting their ability to reach work on time, which leads to lost wages or job opportunities.

---

### **2. Chosen Aspect to Focus On:**

**Aspect**: Lack of real-time information on public transport schedules.

---

### **3. Reasoning:**

"I have chosen the aspect of providing real-time information on public transport schedules because it directly addresses the problem of missed buses and trains, which affects the punctuality and productivity of low-income workers. A user-friendly app that provides real-time updates can empower workers to plan their journeys better, save time, and reduce stress. This solution could also improve overall job security by ensuring reliable transportation access."

---

### **4. Problem Statement:**

"Low-income workers in urban areas face significant challenges due to the lack of real-time information on public transport schedules, resulting in frequent delays, missed work shifts, and reduced income. The lack of reliable information during peak hours exacerbates the problem, particularly in cities where public transportation is already overcrowded and unreliable. A user-friendly mobile app providing real-time transport updates will help workers plan their commutes efficiently, saving time and reducing the risk of job loss due to transportation issues."

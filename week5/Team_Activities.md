# Team Roles


Before we delve into the details of your first Team meeting this week, let’s familiarize ourselves with some of the key roles typically found in a tech team, which you will be assuming as part of your Month 2 project. We have already talked about a few of these roles when we introduced Agile Teams. Some of the roles will be new to you and the article below will explain what each one entails.

Your team role will play an essential function in the development and success of your team’s tech project. Let’s explore what the options are.

Team Project Roles Explained
Project Manager
In a tech team project, the Project Manager plays a crucial role in ensuring smooth
coordination and timely completion of tasks. They are responsible for creating
schedules, setting deadlines, and tracking progress to ensure that everyone is on track.
They facilitate communication among team members, ensuring that everyone
understands their roles and responsibilities. The Project Manager helps manage the
project's timeline, keeping an eye on potential risks and issues that may arise, and
taking necessary steps to mitigate them.
Product Manager
The Product Manager takes on the role of advocating for the solution and shaping its
direction. They work closely with the team to understand the insights gathered by the
UX Researcher and translate them into actionable product requirements. They play a
key role in defining the vision and strategy for the solution, prioritizing features, and
ensuring that the final product aligns with user needs and expectations. The Product
Manager serves as a bridge between the development team and other stakeholders,
ensuring effective communication and successful product delivery.
UX Researcher
The UX Researcher focuses on understanding how users are challenged by the
identified problem. They conduct research activities, such as user interviews, surveys,
and usability testing, to gather insights into user behavior, needs, and pain points. They
analyze the collected data to identify patterns and trends, which inform the design and
development process. The UX Researcher plays a vital role in ensuring that the final
solution is user-centered, addressing the specific needs and preferences of the target
audience.
UI/UX Designer
The UI/UX Designer is responsible for creating a visually appealing and user-friendly
interface for the solution. They work closely with the Product Manager and UX
Researcher to translate user requirements into intuitive designs. They create
wireframes, prototypes, and interactive mock-ups to visualize the user journey and
ensure a seamless user experience. The UI/UX Designer applies principles of user
interface design, information architecture, and visual design to create an interface that is
both aesthetically pleasing and functional, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
Data Analyst(s)
The Data Analyst(s) is responsible for working with relevant data sets and creating data
visualizations that support a comprehensive understanding of the problem, users, and
the potential impact of the solution. They gather, clean, and analyze data to extract
meaningful insights that can inform decision-making and validate the effectiveness of
the solution. Data Analysts play a critical role in identifying trends, patterns, and
correlations, which can help the team make data-driven decisions and optimize the
solution's performance

# Team Activity: First Team Meeting


Planning your time together is vital so you can be productive and make the most of your time together. We don’t want you to waste your precious time together. To organize your team’s meeting and help it be a success, here is the agenda for your first team meeting. Please make sure you hit all the items on the agenda.

For recording keeping and accountability, create a shared Google Doc that all teammates have access to, where you can record the key team decisions and action items.

Team Meeting Agenda (

First Team Meeting Agenda

1. Introductions. Every person should introduce themselves by saying their name, and why they are in the program. They should share their mission statement and their strengths.

2. Hummingbird Report. Each person should share briefly about 1 Hummingbird they interviewed and what inspired them about this person. You should each speak succinctly to the following points:
A. What problem is your Hummingbird tackling (or have they tackled)?
B. How are they helping solve it?
C. What did you find most inspiring about their action?

We encourage you to use pictures, visuals or prompts to enhance your story and make it more compelling.

3. Problem statements. Each person should then share their problem statements from Milestones # 3, which they also should have shared online during the “Individual + Team Activity: Reflection & Scoping the Problem” on the portal.

4. As a team, you must decide on 1 problem statement that will be the focus of your team project for the entire month. In order to do this, you must first have a healthy discussion. We encourage you to advocate for ideas you like and feel passionate about, while also listening and considering others' preferences. State your case and know when to make compromises.

Everyone should ideally feel good about the decision. Your team's problem statement can be 1 person's problem statement, or it could potentially be a combination of 2 or more people's problem statements. It could also be entirely new for the team. The only 3 requirements for your chosen problem statement are that:
A. It relates to a GCGO.
B. Is clearly defined, including the population affected.
C. It can potentially be addressed using some type of technology (such as an app or a
physical device).

It doesn't have to be specific to your local community, but you may want to consider this possibility. Make sure your team can answer the questions from the McKinsey Problem Solving Framework about your problem.
● What is the problem?
● Where and when does the problem occur?
● Who is affected?
● What will make a solution successful?
● What are the boundaries of this problem?
● Who or what can stop you from implementing the solution?

Someone must write up the full problem statement in the Google Doc, and another person should review it.

Example Problem Statement
The lack of accessible and reliable information about informal transport services severely impacts elderly citizens in various locations across Africa, who heavily rely on these services for their transportation needs.

Without easy access to accurate information, elderly individuals face significant challenges in planning and navigating their journeys effectively, leading to inconvenience, confusion, and potential safety risks.

The problem disproportionately affects the demographic of elderly citizens, who often have limited technological literacy and may struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving digital platforms.

Addressing this issue requires the development of a user-friendly and centralized
information hub specifically tailored to the needs of elderly users, ensuring equitable
access to essential transportation information and empowering them to travel safely and independently.

5. Team Roles. The team should also agree upon the roles each person will play for the month. Every person should have a primary role and a backup role. The roles are:
Project Manager - responsible for helping with scheduling, timing of work, and making sure each person is completing their tasks on time. Keeping track of action items and key deliverables.
Product Manager - responsible for advocating for the solution and helping it take shape, and putting info from the UX researcher into action.
UX Researcher - responsible for understanding how users are challenged by the problem.
UI/UX Designer - responsible for making the solution user-friendly and intuitive.
Data Analyst(s) - responsible for finding and/or creating data visualizations that support understanding the problem, users, and the impact of a potential solution.

Note that it’s not a requirement to have all the roles covered in your team – this is just an opportunity to practice. Taking a specific role does not prevent you from doing any other type of work. You should all be working together to get the job done.

Remember to write the role assignments in your shared Google Doc.

6. Discuss what types of research you want to do on your problem. What kinds of information might you find to illustrate the scope and impact of the problem? You will need to locate data and visualize it or find existing data visualizations after the meeting has ended and before Milestone # 6 is due. Please see the Activity: Finding a Relevant Dataset for Your Team Problem. You will also need to come to some specific conclusions about the work to be done and record these in the Google doc. The data analyst(s) and backup data analyst(s) should have primary responsibility for the work, but everyone is encouraged to contribute. And each person is individually accountable to make sure the work gets done.

7. Determine when your meeting for Week 8 will take place. It should be fairly early in the week. It should ideally be a time when everyone can make it. If you can't find a time everyone can make, then find a time that the highest number of people can make and decide how the missing member(s) will get the information and contribute.

8. Capture any questions or comments team members may have.

9. Recap each person's action items before the next team meeting in Week 7. Make sure everyone is clear on their responsibilities, and that they are listed in your shared Google doc.

10. Now that you have broken the ice and know each other, decide on a cool team
name that reflects what you want to accomplish as a team. This is just for fun, so don't stress too much.

11. Have a mini 5-minute retro or "post-mortem" session. Discuss The following areas with regard to the current team meeting.
● What went well?
● What did not go so well? How will the team avoid this in future meetings?
● How can the team improve on running the meeting efficiently in Week 8?

12. Conclude the meeting. You are personally responsible to come out of this meeting with the following (which form part of your Milestone # 6 submission):
The date & time your team met
The group name
Your team’s agreed-upon problem statement (this should be the same for every team member)
Your team roles, primary and backup (this should be the same for every team member)
Your action items (what you need to do prior to Milestone # 6)
The scheduled date and time of the next meeting


```
)
1. Introductions. Every person should introduce themselves by saying their name, and why they are in the program. They should share their mission statement and their strengths.

2. Problem statements. Each person should then briefly speak on their Problem Statements from Month 1, which they also should have already shared with the team in [this activity](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/100992).
```
Tasks
0. Individual + Team Activity: Reflection & Scoping the Problem
mandatory
Now that you have reviewed your Milestones # 3 and 4 it is time to prepare for your first team meeting.
This activity will build on the work you did for Milestones # 3 and 4 so please have both Milestones handy so you can easily reference them.

(If your Milestone # 3 is different to your Milestone # 4, choose one that you want to work with and have that close so you can reference it.)

Based on your understanding of the Global Challenge and Global Opportunity you chose and the problem you identified in Month 1, you will now identify 2 or 3 specific aspects of the broader problem that you would like to address as part of your peer project this month. This will help focus your efforts and allow you to delve deeper into specific areas of interest.

Instructions:
Complete the below steps in a Google Doc that you will share with your team.

STEP 1
1. In your Google Doc, write your chosen GCGO and the problem you identified as part of your Milestones # 3 and 4. If your Milestones # 3 and 4 speak to different problems, choose one you would like to work on further.



2. Reflect on the overarching topic you have selected and the specific problem you have identified within that topic.

Example: If your chosen GCGO is Infrastructure and the identified problem in your community is transportation for the elderly, think about specific aspects related to transportation that could be addressed.



3. Select 2 or 3 possible aspects to tackle: Zoom in closer to your problem and narrow down to 2 - 3 specific aspects within the broad topic that you would like to focus on during your peer project. These aspects should be specific and related to the problem you have identified. (There is no need to write these in your Google Doc as yet. You can just jot them down somewhere.)

Using the above example, our aspects are:

Aspect 1: Lack of Senior-Friendly Bus Stops: The lack of senior-friendly infrastructure at bus stops.
Aspect 2: Lack of a centralized information hub for informal transport services: lack of accessible and reliable information about informal transport services


4. Choose 1 aspect to focus on. Among the 2 - 3 aspects of your problem that you have come up with, select the one that intrigues you the most. Write it in your Google Doc.

Example: Among the three aspects we identified, our most intriguing aspect is the “Centralized Information Hub for Informal Transport Services”



5. Explain your reasoning: In your Google Doc write a brief explanation of why you have chosen the particular aspect and how you believe it contributes to addressing the identified problem.

Example reasoning

I have chosen Aspect 2: Centralized Information Hub for Informal Transport Services as it emphasizes the importance of accessible information to empower elderly citizens in utilizing informal transport services. Creating a centralized platform, such as an easy-to-use mobile app or website for the elderly, that provides reliable information about available informal transport services, routes, fares, and schedules empowers elderly citizens to make informed decisions and navigate the informal transport system with ease.

If we had chosen Aspect 1 our explanation would be:

Aspect 1: Senior-Friendly Bus Stops focuses on enhancing physical infrastructure to create an inclusive and comfortable environment at bus stops, By designing bus stops that cater to the needs of elderly citizens with features like comfortable seating, shelter, clear signage, and accessibility features, we can remove physical barriers and make public transportation more convenient and comfortable for them.



Remember, in Week 7 you will be prototyping/wireframing. So your chosen aspects should be one that will allow you (and your team) to develop a solution that involves some type of technology as a solution or partial solution.



STEP 2
In your Google Doc, use the McKinsey Problem Statement Framework to outline the different elements of the specific aspect you have selected, then come up with a Problem Statement for that aspect.

Remember, your statement must answer the 5Ws+1H.

Example
Using the McKinsey Problem Statement Framework, we will outline the different elements of our example problem and formulate a problem statement:

What is the problem? Limited accessibility to reliable information about informal transport services.

Where and when does the problem occur? This problem occurs in various locations in Africa, where informal transport services are prevalent. For this activity, we are focusing on Binga, Zimbabwe.

Who is affected? Elderly citizens who rely on these services and need accurate information to plan their journeys effectively.

What will make a solution successful? A successful solution relies on developing a user-friendly centralized information hub, ensuring widespread adoption and awareness among elderly citizens, and collaborating with informal transport service providers for accurate and timely updates.

What are the boundaries of this problem? The solution focuses on addressing the information gap specifically for informal transport services and may not encompass other modes of transportation.

Who or what can stop you from implementing the solution? Limited technological literacy among elderly citizens, inadequate internet connectivity in some areas, and resistance to change by informal transport service providers may hinder the implementation of the solution.

Problem Statement

The lack of accessible and reliable information about informal transport services severely impacts elderly citizens in various locations across Africa, who heavily rely on these services for their transportation needs.

Without easy access to accurate information, elderly individuals face significant challenges in planning and navigating their journeys effectively, leading to inconvenience, confusion, and potential safety risks.

The problem disproportionately affects the demographic of elderly citizens, who often have limited technological literacy and may struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving digital platforms.

Addressing this issue requires the development of a user-friendly and centralized information hub specifically tailored to the needs of elderly users, ensuring equitable access to essential transportation information and empowering them to travel safely and independently.



STEP 3
Each team member must share with the team the link to the Google Doc with their Problem Statement. Sharing can be done on the team Portal DM, and the document must be shared at least 4 hours before the first team meeting this week, so that the group has time to read through each Problem Statement.

Before sharing, ensure your Google Doc is set such that “anyone with the link can view it”.

During the first team meeting your group will decide on one Problem Statement to work on as a team.
```
3. As a team, you must decide on 1 problem statement that will be the focus of your team project for the entire month. In order to do this, you must first have a healthy discussion. We encourage you to advocate for ideas you like and feel passionate about, while also listening and considering others’ preferences. State your case and know when to make compromises. Everyone should ideally feel good about the decision. Your team’s problem statement can be 1 person’s problem statement, or it could potentially be a combination of 2 or more people’s problem statements. It could also be entirely new for the team.

The only 3 requirements for your chosen problem statement are that:

A. It relates to a GCGO.

B. Is clearly defined, including the population affected.

C. It can potentially be addressed using some type of technology (such as an app or a physical device).

It doesn’t have to be specific to your local community, but you may want to consider this possibility. Make sure your team can answer the questions from the McKinsey Problem Solving Framework about your problem.

What is the problem?
Where and when does the problem occur?
Who is affected?
What will make a solution successful?
What are the boundaries of this problem?
Who or what can stop you from implementing the solution?
Someone must write up the full problem statement in the Google Doc, and another person should review it.

You will need to locate data and visualize it or find existing data visualizations after the meeting has ended and before Milestone # 6 is due. Please see [Team Online Activity: Data Research & Visualization.](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/104538)
```
Team Online Activity 2: Data Research & Visualization


It is time to choose the visuals that represent you as a team. All team members must participate in this activity.

Once all team members have shared their personal data sets and visualizations for your chosen team problem, the next step is for the team to meet online and collectively decide on three visualizations that they want to include as part of their Week #5 Milestone submission.

These selections will determine the focus of the team’s efforts for the remainder of month 2. Each visualization chosen must strongly align with the team’s problem statement and problem data set.

It is essential that each team member, including yourself, actively participates in the decision-making process and contributes their opinions and insights. The aim is to reach a consensus on the top 3 visualizations that align with the team’s goals and priorities.

Consider the following steps to facilitate the decision-making process as a team:

Review and Discuss: Take the time to carefully review and discuss each team member’s data sets and visualizations. Share your thoughts and observations regarding the strengths, relevance, and potential impact of each visualization.

Evaluate Alignment: Assess how well each visualization aligns with the problem and the team’s overall goals and objectives. Consider factors such as the visibility, clarity reliability and effectiveness of the visualization. Remember your visualizations must tell a compelling story.

Facilitate Discussion: Encourage open and constructive dialogue among team members. Give each team member an opportunity to express their preferences and provide reasoning for their choices. Listen actively and respect diverse viewpoints.

Seek Consensus: Aim to find common ground and identify the visualizations that receive the most support from the team. Look for areas of agreement and work towards a shared understanding of the top 3 visualizations.

Finalize Selections: Once the team has reached a consensus, go back to the Team Google Doc from the first meeting and document the decisions regarding the 3 chosen visualizations and data sets.

For effective teamwork, do your best to ensure that the majority of team members are in agreement with the selections.

Decide on which visualizations to submit as part of Week #5 Milestone. Of the 3 top visualizations that the team has chosen, discuss and agree on 2 that each member of the team will submit as part of Week #5 Milestone.

Happy Choosing!

# Team Assignments


Guess what? It is time to gear up for your first team assignment for Month 2. This is where you will experience real-life tech scenarios showing you how teams collaborate in the tech space. Imagine working together to find super cool solutions. Exciting right?!

It’s like solving puzzles but with a tech twist.

If you are still wondering why we’re doing month 2 projects in teams and not as individuals, here are a few of our Why:

Collaboration Skills: Working in a team will help you develop essential collaboration skills. In the real world, most tech projects involve teams of talented individuals coming together to create something amazing. By experiencing teamwork firsthand, you’ll learn how to communicate effectively, delegate tasks, and leverage each other’s strengths.

Problem-Solving Power: When you work with others, you bring together a variety of perspectives and ideas. In a tech team, this diversity is key to solving complex problems. By simulating these scenarios, you’ll learn how to brainstorm ideas, analyze different approaches, and find innovative solutions together.

Agile Adaptability: The tech industry moves at lightning speed, and being adaptable is crucial. You’ll face challenges, unexpected twists, and tight deadlines in a team setting—just like in real-life tech projects. By navigating these situations as a team, you’ll develop resilience, flexibility, and the ability to thrive in fast-paced environments.

Building Trust: Trust is the foundation of successful teams. Through teamwork, you’ll learn how to trust your teammates and build strong professional relationships. Trusting others allows for effective collaboration and creates a supportive and positive work environment.

Amplified Creativity: Two heads are better than one, right? Working in a team boosts creativity by combining everyone’s unique ideas and perspectives. By collaborating, you’ll discover fresh approaches, spark new innovations, and bring out the best in each other.

So, by simulating real-life tech team scenarios, we’re preparing you for an exciting future in the tech world. We hope that you will embrace the challenges, learn from one another, and have a blast working together!

Remember, teamwork makes the tech dream work!

# Team Meeting Preparation


Once you have all introduced each other as a group, the next step as a team is to decide on the DATE and TIME you can all meet online, or at your local City Hub, this week. Everyone must endeavor to attend as this will be the first team meeting and will set the tone for the rest of the month.

Ideally, your meeting time and date must be early on in the week or mid-week, so you have time to complete your individual Milestones 6 write-up. Make sure your team confirms the first team meeting date right after the introductions.

Meeting Preparation
What is the secret sauce to being an awesome team member? Planning ahead and being proactive! Make sure you arrive at meetings on time and fully prepared.

For your first team meeting, come prepared to:
Introduce yourself to your team.
Share why you are in this program.
Share your [Personal Mission Statement (from Week 2)](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/1mnBXu3K9JZG_ulrkngGgw)
Share your strengths, which are part of your [PICS (Passions, Interests, Causes and Strengths)](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/1mnBXu3K9JZG_ulrkngGgw) from Week 2.
Share about 1 hummingbird you interviewed and what was inspiring about them.
Share your problem statement from the previous activity. (You should have already completed this part so that everyone would have had the opportunity to read your problem statement before the first team meeting.)
Make sure you have each of these items open. Please compile them into one location on your computer so you can immediately find them.

# The Ideal Team Member
So, what does an ideal team member look like? What does it really mean to be a good team player?

An ideal team member:

Is Reliable: A great team player is someone others can depend on. Show up on time, meet deadlines, and fulfil your commitments. Be the person your teammates know they can count on.

Communicates Effectively: Communication is key! Listen attentively, express your ideas clearly, and be open to different perspectives. Create a positive and inclusive environment where everyone’s voice is valued.

Embraces Collaboration: Working together is where the magic happens! Embrace collaboration by sharing responsibilities, supporting your peers, and actively participating in group activities. Remember, we’re stronger when we work as a team.

Displays Respect: Treat your teammates with kindness, empathy, and respect. Value their opinions, celebrate their achievements, and offer constructive feedback. A respectful team environment fosters trust and boosts productivity.

Sets Personal Principles: Reflect on the principles that guide you as an individual. What values do you hold dear? How can you incorporate these principles into your teamwork? Define your personal code of conduct and let it shine through in your interactions. (We will have time to do this in the next activity.)

Stretches Themself: Challenge yourself to step outside your comfort zone and contribute in ways that showcase your unique strengths. Take on new responsibilities, offer innovative ideas, and support your peers in their growth. Stretching yourself leads to personal growth and remarkable contributions.

Being a remarkable team player is not just about doing the bare minimum—it’s about going above and beyond to support your peers and elevate the entire group.

We love the next video as it sheds perspective on other considerations of being a good team player. Take a look and as you watch, jot down all the elements listed on being a good team member.

While collaboration is more than just working together,
the skills involved in successful teamwork
are important to successful collaboration.
It's important to be a good team player.
Every organization success relies on effective teams.
And modern teams are often made up
of a diverse mix of individuals and circumstances.
They may be cross functional or multi-disciplinary.
They may be collocated or collaborate remotely.
They may be made up of familiar co-workers or complete strangers.
There may be cultural or language barriers to overcome
in order to work together successfully.
But regardless of the team situation,
the basic principles of being a good team member apply.
In almost everything you read about being a good team member,
there are the same lists of basic qualities
such as being honest, fair, respectful, reliable,
responsible, and a good communicator.
But there's more to being an outstanding team member,
qualities that don't always get the proper attention.
A good work team member shows genuine commitment.
There's a tangible difference between someone who shows up to work on a team
and someone who is genuinely committed to the team's goals.
If you're committed, you're in the office when needed,
and you make sure that your seat time is worth it,
by contributing as much as possible while you're there.
The best team members get involved.
It does not serve you well to just sit quietly and
do your work in a silo. Don't stay in the shadows.
Instead, get involved with your team.
If you don't know something, find out by asking team members questions.
Strong team players come to their teammates
prepared with their questions and ideas clearly thought through.
Solid team members need to be transparent.
Sharing opinions and ideas is important,
as long as they don't actually belong to someone else.
You don't have to take credit for everything.
In fact, giving credit for ideas you're sharing earns you respect and trust.
As an outstanding team worker,
you must be ready to help even if it's not in your job description.
Be generous with pointers or tips to help your team members.
For example, if a member is experiencing frustration when using a new technology
that you're experienced with, offer your help and share what you know.
Along those lines, successful team members work to be problem-solvers,
not problem-makers. Help resolve problems even if they aren't directly yours.
If a teammate is stuck with a problem she's working on,
take the initiative and try to solve it, or at least help.
This earns you respect
and is sure to come back at you someday in a positive way.
When you have a problem in the future,
it may be you on the receiving end,
especially if people remember how you've given of your time before.
And as a good teammate, recognize and acknowledge when you're wrong.
The point is to work hard and be good at what you do,
not try to be right all the time.
Being stubborn is not a quality of a good team player.
Team members respect you when you admit you're wrong,
or when you back off an idea when it's clear it's not the right path.
If you strongly believe that your team is making a mistake,
you can usually find a way to come back to the issue when the time is right.
And if it happens that you are correct, accept it gracefully.
These, of course, are hardly the only characteristics of good team members,
but they provide a solid starting point for successful collaboration.
They are a blueprint
for beginning the work of successfully working together with others.

# Best Practices for Working in a Team
Your success as a team is at the top of our list so we put together a few guidelines to help you thrive as a collaborative front.

Here are a few things that you should definitely DO as a team:

Communicate and communicate some more: We already covered the importance of communication in Week 4. As a team, you must foster open and honest communication. Listen actively, express your thoughts clearly, and provide constructive feedback. Communication is the lifeline of effective teamwork.

Fairly contribute and divide the workload: That means you must embrace collaboration by actively participating in team discussions, sharing ideas, and being open to different perspectives. Divide tasks fairly and leverage each team member’s strengths for optimal results.

Respect and value differences: Embrace diversity and respect the unique strengths, perspectives, and backgrounds of your teammates. Your team should foster an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and heard.

Foster trust and build relationships: Cultivate trust within your team by being reliable, keeping your commitments, and supporting your teammates. Build strong relationships based on respect, empathy, and integrity.

Set clear goals and expectations: We cannot emphasize the importance of goal setting to maximize your time. As a team, you must define clear goals and establish shared expectations within your team. Ensure everyone understands their roles, responsibilities, and deadlines to promote accountability and keep everyone aligned.

We also want you to know Google’s take on the traits of a successful team. They conducted a study and shared their findings in this short insightful video. It reminded us of 2 main learnings we covered in Month 1: Communication and Empathy. Take a look.

technology companies encourage their
employees to work together because
studies show the teams tend to innovate
faster achieve higher productivity see
mistakes more quickly and find better
solutions to problems yet not every team
Why companies encourage teamwork
is successful so how do you build a
highly effective team that is capable of
delivering expected results
a study run by Google will shed some
light on this question and help us
identify trades that all successful
Google teams shared several years ago
who will launch an internal project
Aristotle which was a huge data study
focused on the teamwork the tech giant
The study
spent millions of dollars tracking 180
separate teams for three years the goal
of the project was simple yet ambitious
to find out what are the traits of the
highest performing teams in other words
the company wanted to know why some
teams stumbled while others sort
initially the researchers hypothesis was
that maybe best teams had members who
liked each other a lot or there was a
healthy mix of personality types while
the team members were friends outside of
work
yet none of these seemed to matter
the researchers could not find any
meaningful patterns in the data
basically there was no evidence that a
mix of specific personality types or
skills or backgrounds
made any difference the whole part of
the equation didn't seem to matter as
the researchers continued to study the
group's
they noticed two behaviors that all of
the best teams shared first is that the
Inequality
team members spoke in roughly the same
proportion a phenomenon the researchers
call inequality in distribution of
conversational turn-taking
on some teams everyone spoke during each
task while on others leadership shifted
among teammates from assignment to
assignment but in each case at the end
of the day everyone had spoken roughly
the same amount in other words as long
as everyone got a chance to talk the
team did well but if only one person or
a small group spoke all the time the
collective intelligence declined second
Social sensitivity
the good teams all had high average
social sensitivity a fancy way of saying
they were skilled at reading how others
felt based on their tone of voice their
expressions in other nonverbal cues one
of the easiest way to determine social
sensitivity is to show someone photos of
a person's eyes and ask to describe what
that person is feeling an exam known as
reading the mind in the eyes people on
successful teams scored about average on
this test they seemed to know when
someone was feeling upset or left out
people on less effective teams in
contrast scored below average they
seemed to be less sensitive towards
their colleagues by the end of the
Conclusion
project researchers came to conclusion
that it didn't matter who was on the
team what mattered was how team members
treated each other
teams were everybody talked and
everybody showed respect by listening
and paying attention created
psychologically safe atmosphere inside
the team and psychological safety of
each member in the group had a positive
effect on the team's ability to succeed

# Worst Practices for Working in a Team
And the NO-NOs are…
Micromanaging: Trust your teammates to deliver on their responsibilities. Avoid excessive control or micromanagement, as it can hinder creativity, motivation, and autonomy within the team.

Being Afraid to Ask for Help: It’s okay to ask for assistance when needed. Don’t let ego or fear hold you back from seeking support from your teammates. Remember, you’re a team, and you’re in it together.

Negativity and Blame Games: Foster a positive team environment by refraining from negative criticism, blame games, or gossip. Instead, focus on constructive feedback and finding solutions to challenges.

Ignoring Conflict: It’s not going to magically disappear so address conflict proactively rather than sweeping it under the rug. Always encourage open dialogue, and active listening, and seek resolutions that benefit the entire team.

Procrastination: (Is that even a word in our ALX Dictionary). As young leaders we get things done, but assuming procrastination is actually a thing, it can significantly hinder progress and impact team morale. Stay organized, manage your time effectively, and meet deadlines to ensure a smooth workflow within the team.

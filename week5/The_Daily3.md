# Movement: Try Something New
In Month 1, we danced our hearts out and tried exciting Afro Dance Challenges! This week, we want to offer you another chance to shake things up by trying something new!

You can break out more of those dance moves, jump on a trampoline, jog around your community, or try your hand at hula hooping. If you already have a movement routine that works for you, great! But if you’re still dialling it in, here are some suggestions for new movements you can try this week. Pick one that aligns with your interests and fitness level, or try them all!

1. Yoga or stretching: Engage in gentle yoga poses or stretching exercises to improve flexibility, promote relaxation, and enhance body awareness. There are many online videos to guide you through these exercises, too.

2. Dancing: Turn up the music and let loose with some dance moves in the comfort of your own space. It’s a great way to have fun while getting your body moving.

3. Home workouts: Explore online workout videos or fitness apps that offer a variety of exercises you can do at home, such as body weight workouts, HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training), or Pilates.

4. Cycling: Dust off that bike and go for a ride around your neighbourhood, or find a scenic cycling route nearby.

5. Swimming or water exercises: If you can swim, and have access to a pool or aquatic facility, swimming or water exercises can provide a low-impact yet effective full-body workout.

6. Walking or jogging: Walking is so good for you! Take a stroll in your neighbourhood or find a scenic trail to explore. If you’re up for it, challenge yourself with a light jog to get your heart rate up.

7. Group classes: If it’s available to you, join a local fitness centre or community centre that offers group exercise classes like Zumba, aerobics, weight training, or spinning.

You can also try just walking in the comfort of your home! You are more than welcome to join and follow along with this video.

Remember, any movement of any kind is so much better than no movement at all. So, take baby steps and challenge yourself to work just a little bit harder!

Important Note: Safety first! When exploring new movement activities, it’s essential to prioritize your well-being and choose options that are safe and suitable for your health.

# Skills Inventory: Take 2
One more thing and we are done with this week’s Daily 3 activities. This time, we would like you to reflect on your journey so far and how your skills have developed. You’ve learned a lot of valuable skills and habits and you’ve also unlearned some of the norms and habits that do not bring you any benefit.

You are making tremendous progress and now is a good time for you to step back and track your growth over the past 4 weeks. Here is what you need to do:

1. In Week 1 we shared this [Skills Tracker](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/rNt2rbxhJf5lSd_R29T4xw) and asked you to create a personal copy. You also completed the Before Foundations column as a baseline record of your skillsets before starting the Foundations Program.

Now, open that same personal copy with your skills tracker. This is the skills update file you will be completing this week.

2. Read the instructions at the top of the page to remind yourself of how to complete the sheet.



3. Complete the Growth Tracking 2 section - Columns C and H, on the page. This will help you track your progress and growth for the past 6 weeks.



4. For each of the skills, rate your skillset as they are now since you started the program. Rate yourself:

Enter 5 if you have shown exceptional growth and reached a satisfactory level of competence in this area. Enter 4 if you have made substantial progress and are confident in your abilities. Enter 3 if you have made noticeable strides and have a decent level of proficiency. Enter 2 if you’ve experienced minor improvements, but there’s still room for substantial progress. Enter 1 if you feel that your growth in this area has been minimal or negligible.

5. At the bottom of the sheet, list at least 3 skills that you scored between 1 and 3 in, and are personally eager to grow.

Remember, YOU are the master of your own ALX journey!

Continue to cultivate curiosity towards new skills, demonstrate proactivity in acquiring them, and take ownership of your own learning experience. As we said before,this T-shirt might just be the right fit for you.

# Team Activity: First Team Meeting


Planning your time together is vital so you can be productive and make the most of your time together. We don’t want you to waste your precious time together. To organize your team’s meeting and help it be a success, here is the agenda for your first team meeting. Please make sure you hit all the items on the agenda.

For recording keeping and accountability, create a shared Google Doc that all teammates have access to, where you can record the key team decisions and action items.

Team Meeting Agenda (you can download a .pdf version HERE)
1. Introductions. Every person should introduce themselves by saying their name, and why they are in the program. They should share their mission statement and their strengths.

2. Problem statements. Each person should then briefly speak on their Problem Statements from Month 1, which they also should have already shared with the team in this activity.

3. As a team, you must decide on 1 problem statement that will be the focus of your team project for the entire month. In order to do this, you must first have a healthy discussion. We encourage you to advocate for ideas you like and feel passionate about, while also listening and considering others’ preferences. State your case and know when to make compromises. Everyone should ideally feel good about the decision. Your team’s problem statement can be 1 person’s problem statement, or it could potentially be a combination of 2 or more people’s problem statements. It could also be entirely new for the team.

The only 3 requirements for your chosen problem statement are that:

A. It relates to a GCGO.

B. Is clearly defined, including the population affected.

C. It can potentially be addressed using some type of technology (such as an app or a physical device).

It doesn’t have to be specific to your local community, but you may want to consider this possibility. Make sure your team can answer the questions from the McKinsey Problem Solving Framework about your problem.

What is the problem?
Where and when does the problem occur?
Who is affected?
What will make a solution successful?
What are the boundaries of this problem?
Who or what can stop you from implementing the solution?
Someone must write up the full problem statement in the Google Doc, and another person should review it.

Example Problem Statement
The lack of accessible and reliable information about informal transport services severely impacts elderly citizens in various locations across Africa, who heavily rely on these services for their transportation needs.

Without easy access to accurate information, elderly individuals face significant challenges in planning and navigating their journeys effectively, leading to inconvenience, confusion, and potential safety risks.

The problem disproportionately affects the demographic of elderly citizens, who often have limited technological literacy and may struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving digital platforms.

Addressing this issue requires the development of a user-friendly and centralized information hub specifically tailored to the needs of elderly users, ensuring equitable access to essential transportation information and empowering them to travel safely and independently.

4. Team Roles. The team should also agree upon the roles each person will play for the month. Every person should have a primary role and a backup role. The roles are:

Project Manager- responsible for helping with scheduling, timing of work, and making sure each person is completing their tasks on time. Keeping track of action items and key deliverables.

Product Manager- responsible for advocating for the solution and helping it take shape, and putting info from the UX researcher into action.

UX Researcher- responsible for understanding how users are challenged by the problem.

UI/UX Designer- responsible for making the solution user-friendly and intuitive.

Data Analyst(s)- responsible for finding and/or creating data visualizations that support understanding the problem, users, and the impact of a potential solution.

Note that it’s not a requirement to have all the roles covered in your team– this is just an opportunity to practice. Taking a specific role does not prevent you from doing any other type of work. You should all be working together to get the job done.

Remember to write the role assignments in your shared Google Doc.

5. Discuss what types of research you want to do on your problem. What kinds of information might you find to illustrate the scope and impact of the problem? You will need to locate data and visualize it or find existing data visualizations after the meeting has ended and before Milestone # 6 is due. Please see Team Online Activity: Data Research & Visualization. You will also need to come to some specific conclusions about the work to be done and record these in the Google doc. The data analyst(s) and backup data analyst(s) should have primary responsibility for the work, but everyone is encouraged to contribute. And each person is individually accountable to make sure the work gets done.

6. Determine when your meeting for Week 6 will take place. It should be fairly early in the week. It should ideally be a time when everyone can make it. If you can’t find a time everyone can make, then find a time that the highest number of people can make and decide how the missing member(s) will get the information and contribute.

7. Capture any questions or comments team members may have.

8. Recap each person’s action items before the next team meeting in Week 6. Make sure everyone is clear on their responsibilities, and that they are listed in your shared Google doc.

9. Now that you have broken the ice and know each other, decide on a cool team name that reflects what you want to accomplish as a team. This is just for fun, so don’t stress too much.

10. Have a mini 5-minute retro session.

Discuss the following areas about the current team meeting.

What went well?
What did not go so well? How will the team avoid this in future meetings?
How can the team improve on running the meeting efficiently in Week 6?
11. Conclude the meeting.

You are personally responsible to come out of this meeting with the following (which form part of your Milestone # 5 submission):

The date & time your team met.
Your team name.
Your team’s agreed-upon problem statement (this should be the same for every team member).
Your team roles, primary and backup. This should be the same for every team member. You will need to provide at least 4 team member names and roles for Milestone # 5. If you have more than 4 members in your team, list them all.
Your action items (what you need to do before Milestone # 5). You should have at least 2 action items.
The scheduled date and time of the next meeting in Week 6.

# First Team Meeting Agenda

1. Introductions. Every person should introduce themselves by saying their name, and why they are in the program. They should share their mission statement and their strengths.

2. Hummingbird Report. Each person should share briefly about 1 Hummingbird they interviewed and what inspired them about this person. You should each speak succinctly to the following points:
A. What problem is your Hummingbird tackling (or have they tackled)?
B. How are they helping solve it?
C. What did you find most inspiring about their action?

We encourage you to use pictures, visuals or prompts to enhance your story and make it more compelling.

3. Problem statements. Each person should then share their problem statements from Milestones # 3, which they also should have shared online during the “Individual + Team Activity: Reflection & Scoping the Problem” on the portal.

4. As a team, you must decide on 1 problem statement that will be the focus of your team project for the entire month. In order to do this, you must first have a healthy discussion. We encourage you to advocate for ideas you like and feel passionate about, while also listening and considering others' preferences. State your case and know when to make compromises.

Everyone should ideally feel good about the decision. Your team's problem statement can be 1 person's problem statement, or it could potentially be a combination of 2 or more people's problem statements. It could also be entirely new for the team. The only 3 requirements for your chosen problem statement are that:
A. It relates to a GCGO.
B. Is clearly defined, including the population affected.
C. It can potentially be addressed using some type of technology (such as an app or a
physical device).

It doesn't have to be specific to your local community, but you may want to consider this possibility. Make sure your team can answer the questions from the McKinsey Problem Solving Framework about your problem.
● What is the problem?
● Where and when does the problem occur?
● Who is affected?
● What will make a solution successful?
● What are the boundaries of this problem?
● Who or what can stop you from implementing the solution?

# Team Online Activity 2: Data Research & Visualization


It is time to choose the visuals that represent you as a team. All team members must participate in this activity.

Once all team members have shared their personal data sets and visualizations for your chosen team problem, the next step is for the team to meet online and collectively decide on three visualizations that they want to include as part of their Week #5 Milestone submission.

These selections will determine the focus of the team’s efforts for the remainder of month 2. Each visualization chosen must strongly align with the team’s problem statement and problem data set.

It is essential that each team member, including yourself, actively participates in the decision-making process and contributes their opinions and insights. The aim is to reach a consensus on the top 3 visualizations that align with the team’s goals and priorities.

Consider the following steps to facilitate the decision-making process as a team:

Review and Discuss: Take the time to carefully review and discuss each team member’s data sets and visualizations. Share your thoughts and observations regarding the strengths, relevance, and potential impact of each visualization.

Evaluate Alignment: Assess how well each visualization aligns with the problem and the team’s overall goals and objectives. Consider factors such as the visibility, clarity reliability and effectiveness of the visualization. Remember your visualizations must tell a compelling story.

Facilitate Discussion: Encourage open and constructive dialogue among team members. Give each team member an opportunity to express their preferences and provide reasoning for their choices. Listen actively and respect diverse viewpoints.

Seek Consensus: Aim to find common ground and identify the visualizations that receive the most support from the team. Look for areas of agreement and work towards a shared understanding of the top 3 visualizations.

Finalize Selections: Once the team has reached a consensus, go back to the Team Google Doc from the first meeting and document the decisions regarding the 3 chosen visualizations and data sets.

For effective teamwork, do your best to ensure that the majority of team members are in agreement with the selections.

Decide on which visualizations to submit as part of Week #5 Milestone. Of the 3 top visualizations that the team has chosen, discuss and agree on 2 that each member of the team will submit as part of Week #5 Milestone.

Happy Choosing!

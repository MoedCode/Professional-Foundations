SECTION D: Daily 3 Reflection
Step 1: Tally
Please reflect on your past month of Daily 3 practice. For each of the 3 practices, please share an honest reflection on how much you have practiced each of the Daily 3 (provide your best estimate if you haven’t been tracking). You may indicate the total times or average # of times per week.

Step 1: Tally
20 minutes of daily movement. Amount of practice in the past month:
5 minutes of daily meditation. Amount of practice in the past month:
3 pages of daily morning pages. Amount of practice in the past month:





Step 2: Self-Rating
For each practice, rate how satisfied you are personally with how much you have been practicing each of the Daily 3. 1= not at all satisfied, 4= extremely satisfied.

Step 2:  Self-Rating
Daily movement. Your Rating:
Daily meditation. Your Rating:
Daily morning pages. Your Rating:





Step 3: Blocks Analysis
For each practice, indicate what you think the biggest block or obstacle is to achieving a 4 (if you are not at a 4). If you are at a 4, then simply indicate “4” again.


Step 3:  Blocks Analysis
Biggest block to a daily practice of movement:

Biggest block to a daily practice of meditation:

Biggest block to a daily practice of morning pages:





Step 4: Overcoming Blocks
For each practice, brainstorm a few ideas, and then name one specific thing you could realistically do to lessen the block (if you are not at a 4). If you are at a 4, then simply indicate “4” again.

Step 4:  Overcoming Blocks

Step 5: Adapting Practices
For each practice, brainstorm a few ideas, and then name one specific way that you might try to adapt the practice to be more personalized to you. For example, you might prefer singing instead of movement. Or you might prefer a very slow meditative walk in nature instead of seated meditation. Or you might prefer bullet journaling to morning pages. You may also prefer to change the default minimum daily time/amount to less or more than we recommend. It’s your practice– so make it your own! (If you are at a 4, you can still come up with something else you might try to keep your practices fresh.)

Step 5:  How Might You Adapt Each Practice to Better Suit YOU?
I can personalize my movement practice by:


I can personalize my meditation practice by:


C. I can personalize my morning pages practice by:






Step 6: Commitments
For each practice, what do you personally commit to achieving moving forward? You may decide that you wish to officially quit one, two, or all practices. You may decide that you will adapt them to your liking, or not. You may decide on a minimum number of times per week you wish to practice them, or a total number of times. This is for you, and it is completely up to you. There is no right answer.

For each of the 3 Practices, please list what you commit to. Be very specific. What exactly will you do? When will you do it? How often will you do it? How many total times will you do it (if applicable)?

For example, for Movement, you might say:
I commit to completing four 60-minute workouts each week moving forward, for a total of 16 workouts every month. Each workout will involve 20 minutes of cardio, 20 minutes of weight training, and 20 minutes of yoga.

For Meditation, you might say:
I commit to putting on calming music and laying down for at least 10 minutes. I commit to doing this before 6pm in the evening, and I commit to doing it at least every other day. This means I will do this at least 14 times each month.

For Morning Pages, you might say:
I commit to keeping a journal on my desk and writing at least 2 pages whenever I am feeling frustrated or when I feel creatively blocked.

You may also decide that you are not making any commitments, but please still state this.

Step 6:  Commitments
My commitment to Movement for Month 3 is:


My commitment to Meditation for Month 3 is:


My commitment to Morning Pages for Month 3 is:





Step 7: Tracking
You will be checking in again at the end of this month to see how well you have done in meeting your commitment. How will you track your progress? You may keep a Google Sheet, or use a free habit-tracking app like Streaks or Everyday.

Step 7:  Tracking
Be specific. How will you track your progress?






Step 8: Support Plan
How will you help yourself stick to your commitment? It may be an accountability buddy, being willing to make your goals a little easier (which is WAY better than just quitting!), or something else. You may also choose to reward yourself when you reach certain milestones.

Step 8:  Support Plan
Be specific. How will you help yourself stick to your commitment?

 Week 8 Overview - Transcript


Hello everyone! Welcome to this final and triumphant week marking the close of your Professional Foundations learning journey. How time has flown by. It is mind-blowing to think about how far we've come. We are incredibly proud of each one of you for the hard work and dedication you've shown so far.
As we mentioned before, we will be sharing your team projects for those who submit their videos for the showcase. We hope you‚Äôll find them to be both enjoyable and inspirational. We‚Äôve been following the work submitted on Savanna by some of the teams, and we are amazed by the incredible skill, innovative thinking, hard work, and passion for impact displayed. We really hope that most teams will participate in the showcase to share their incredible work. Regardless of sharing, you must all feel proud of your achievements, and for those who are particularly passionate about their ideas, we encourage you to continue developing them and take advantage of the resources available at the Founder Academy of ALX Ventures.
Secondly, this week is your final chance to complete any missing work. All Milestones and tests are due. Please make sure your work is up to date before we wrap up the week.
Remember, to remain eligible for the program, you need to:
Pass all Tests
Pass all Milestones
Complete all module check Multiple Choice Questions
You are so close to the finish line, and now it‚Äôs time to finish strong! Please take this opportunity to make sure that you are all caught up.
Now that we've covered the important reminders, let's shift our attention to reviewing what you learned over the past few weeks. You‚Äôve learnt how to research different problems and solutions, you practiced this with your team GCGO and problem statements, and then you also went on to apply empathy and human-centered design to find solutions that work for the actual people affected. More recently, you‚Äôve been involved in bringing your solution ideas to life through wireframes and prototypes and have also learnt how to pitch your solutions to others as a team!
This week, you will have the opportunity to work on your own professional self. This week you will be working on your personal branding by creating and presenting your elevator pitch and professional bio. You will also be creating and sharing your LinkedIn profile and resumes with us, through a survey, and your peers in your squads on the Portal. We will also be sharing tips and tricks you can use to make yourself stand out through your elevator pitch, professional bio, LinkedIn profile and resume. Not only that, you will also learn how to prepare for job tests and interviews!
So as part of Week 8, you will be completing an individual Milestone, which is a worksheet that includes:
Your elevator pitch
Your professional bio
Your updated LinkedIn profile link
Your updated resume link
Personal reflections on your growth and commitments
Throughout this week, you will also be completing a few surveys. These include:
A feedback survey to help us improve the Foundations program.
A LinkedIn survey for us to keep up to date with your progress and communicate that to our donors.
The self reporting survey if you have a job or academic update to help us with our reporting to our donors.
We also encourage you to share your LinkedIn profile and resume with your peers in your squad channels on The Portal, as well as add these to your profile on The Portal, as it will help you stand out for our partner organizations when they‚Äôre looking for talent.
Speaking of submissions, Week 8 Test will be automatically graded, and you can find the list of covered topics on the following pages here on Savanna.
My heart swells with pride and excitement as I contemplate the sweat and determination you've poured into this journey. You've honed your skills, embraced growth, overcome obstacles, and developed a mindset primed for success.
You inspire us, and we cannot imagine a better cohort to have been on this journey with. We believe in the amazing things that you will continue to do.
This is the last week before this phase of your learning journey ends, so finish strong, make sure you tick all the boxes and submit every piece of work that is required. Then, make sure that you take time to celebrate yourself and your peers. You deserve it!
Wishing you an exceptional Week 8 and a restful break.

# Skills Inventory: Take 3
One more thing and we are done with this week‚Äôs Daily 3 activities. This time, we would like you to reflect on your journey so far and how your skills have developed. You‚Äôve learned a lot of valuable skills and habits and you‚Äôve also unlearned some of the norms and habits that do not bring you any benefit.

You are making tremendous progress and now is a good time for you to step back and track your growth over the past 7 weeks. Here is what you need to do:

1. In Week 1 and 5 we shared this Skills Tracker and asked you to create a personal copy. You also completed the Before Foundations column as a baseline record of your skillsets before starting the Foundations Program.

Now, open that same personal copy with your skills mapping. This is the skills update file you will be completing this week.

2. Read the instructions at the top of the page to remind yourself of how to complete the sheet.
![alt text](image-1.png)


3. Complete the Growth Tracking 2 section - Columns D and I, on the page. This will help you track your progress and growth for the past 6 weeks.
![alt text](image-2.png)



4. For each of the skills, rate your skillset as they are now since you started the program. Rate yourself:

Enter 5 if you have shown exceptional growth and reached a satisfactory level of competence in this area.

Enter 4 if you have made substantial progress and are confident in your abilities.

Enter 3 if you have made noticeable strides and have a decent level of proficiency.

Enter 2 if you‚Äôve experienced minor improvements, but there‚Äôs still room for substantial progress.

Enter 1 if you feel that your growth in this area has been minimal or negligible.

5. At the bottom of the sheet, list at least 3 skills that you scored between 1 and 3 in, and are personally eager to grow.


Remember, YOU are the master of your own ALX journey!


Continue to cultivate curiosity towards new skills, demonstrate proactivity in acquiring them, and take ownership of your own learning experience. As we said before,this T-shirt might just be the right fit for you.

# [Optional] Team Project Showcase


At the end of Week 8, you will have the option to broadcast and share your team‚Äôs groundbreaking creation with your peers.

If you think your team has come up with a great idea and would like the chance to showcase it to ALX staff and your peers, then this is your chance. At the end of this week, we will share a submission form and invite you to enter the ALX Foundations Team Project Showcase. This showcase is optional and your team should only enter if it wishes to.

To officially participate in the showcase, your team needs to assign one person to submit the team‚Äôs pitch video YouTube link. There can only be 1 submission form per team. So make sure you clearly communicate which team member will do the submission.

The Team Project Showcase entry closes by the end next Week. More information on this later in the week!

The submitted videos will be showcased and shared with peers over email, as well as multiple ALX City Hubs.

We cannot wait to see your brilliant ideas!

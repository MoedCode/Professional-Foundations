Intro
the fastest way to land the job you
really want right now is by using
LinkedIn in this video I'm sharing three
little known LinkedIn job search hack to
help you land that perfect position
don't settle for being just a number or
a file on a recruiter's desktop it's
time for you to navigate the job search
maze on LinkedIn and stand out from the
crowd from leveraging your network to
tapping into the power of job alerts
I've Got The Insider tips and tools you
need so grab a notebook grab your
favorite pen or pencil sit back and get
ready to take your LinkedIn job search
to the next level let's jump into it
foreign
Opening LinkedIn
so the very first thing let's talk about
how to maximize your job search
potential and how to unlock the power of
linkedin's jobs section if you're not
already on LinkedIn I want you to open
LinkedIn you're going to go through this
exercise with me okay when you are
logged in you can either click on the
jobs tab at the very top I have an arrow
pointed to it or you can just go to
linkedin.com jobs if you're logged in
it's going to take you to the jobs uh
the jobs tab now the very first thing I
Browsing Jobs
want to talk about is how you're
browsing recommended jobs okay because
this is super important we all know that
you could spend hours and hours and
hours browsing jobs I don't want you to
do that because number one it's going to
waste your time number two it's going to
kill your confidence or number three
you're going to get very frustrated so
we don't want you just to browse
whatever's out there so we're going to
get very specific with your browsing
habits okay we're on the jobs feature
when you go to the jobs tab you're going
to notice on the left hand side we're
going to go through some of these items
on the left hand side but in the very
middle of your screen you're going to
see some sections now LinkedIn sometimes
switches these up sometimes adds some
different sections the ones that I want
you to look at is what it's recommending
for you and then if we look down below
you'll see more jobs for you the
recommended for you that's what LinkedIn
is giving you based on a couple things
they're basing it on your search history
on the platform they're basing it on
your profile they're basing it on your
activity like if you've liked a post
commented on a post yada yada okay
so think about that now the other thing
you'll see in this section which is not
on my screen is you should see something
like um let's say there was a position
that it could apply to you that you do
match up with it slightly it will show
um like still hiring so jobs that maybe
you missed that you didn't apply for
that maybe you've been posted for some
time now
um so you can look at those but let's
get a little bit more specific with how
this list presents okay if I click on
the my jobs tab again that's just that
little alert there on the left hand side
I can take that recommended jobs and I
can actually save it so let's say for
example I don't have a lot of time right
now and I'm just glancing and I'm like
oh this position might be great for me
I'm going to save this for later so you
can actually save that to your jobs tab
if you want to for later to apply next
screenshot that I want you to look at so
again we're still on the jobs tab is I
want you to look at who works for that
company that you might I already know
this is why developing connections on
LinkedIn is so so important now the
other thing I want you to keep in mind
with this screen is you'll be able to
see how many applicants have applied for
the position so in this case I see that
there's five applicants now you're
hopefully looking at your own
recommended for you jobs and you're
seeing how many people have applied
um so on and so forth the other thing I
want you to pay attention to is it will
show you if you can do the easy apply
feature or easy apply button that's
where you use your profile to apply for
a position now I'm going to show you all
of this so don't get super overwhelmed
we're going to take it step by step as
we go through this training okay let's
say that I click on this position or I
click on any position that it's
recommending for me again based on my
profile my search history and my
activity what I want you to pay
attention to is a couple things now this
is a really well written job description
I see who's hiring for the job not all
postings will show you who's hiring I
also can see that this person who's
hiring has added some skills now this is
super super super key you guys the
skills that they add are skills that
number one you should have either in
your headline or your about section on
your resume these should be skills that
you're talking about in the interview
okay so in this example it says
strategic alliances client relations and
then there's one more well what I would
do is I would find really awesome career
stories around these key skills that
they're listing here because that's
what's the most important to them and
that they're putting that on the profile
or on the job description so I want to
talk speak to that now not all companies
will have this information but let me
tell you think of this as your cheat
sheet if it's there now the other thing
I want you to focus on is if it has that
easy apply button we're going to go
through what that looks like in just a
second here some of them will have it
some of them won't and then about the
job again that is all you guys need to
write an amazing profile to write your
resume to write your cover letter and a
freaking Ace your interview and then to
negotiate your salary like this is
basically all you need this page right
here now the next thing I want you to
focus on is notice I'm still on um the
positions I'm still looking at the
positions well notice that second job
down for me I have quite a few
connections that work here I want you to
pay attention to those jobs the reason
why is because we know that when you
have a referral inside the company
you're much more likely to get an
interview and to get hired over someone
who doesn't I want to cover how to set
Job Alerts
up job alerts so when it comes to
setting up job alerts this is such a
great way to stay up to date on what
postings are coming in
um and and positions that are posted
right away the reason why this is super
important is because we have found that
candidates that apply for a position
pretty quickly after it's been opened a
lot of times they have preference or
they're preferred over some candidates
we want you to get your application in
as quickly as possible so that's why we
set this up now all you're going to do
is you're going to go back to the jobs
tab on the left side you're going to
select job alerts okay let me show you
how to set one of these up it's super
super easy when I click on job alerts
it's going to tell me that I have no job
alerts if I have job alerts I'll show
you what that screen looks like in just
a second so we're going to actually go
through and set up a job alert okay so
back on my screen I can be anywhere on
LinkedIn I can be in my news feed I
could be on the jobs tab I could be in
my network tab it doesn't matter you're
going to enter that ideal job title into
the search box on LinkedIn you can be
anywhere but notice it's going to start
seeing that you're looking for and I
just typed in project manager position
in jobs okay so I'm going to make sure I
have the in jobs option selected and
what it's going to do is it's going to
give me all the jobs that it has for
project manager here's the thing you
have to do you need to narrow this down
because if you notice something it's
giving me two hundred and thirty
thousand jobs well I am not going to
spend all that time applying for all 230
000 of those jobs you'll notice on the
right hand side you'll see all filters
you need to click on that all filters
icon I'm going to show you really
quickly what you're going to do when you
click on the all filters you can filter
by the date the job was posted you can
filter by experience level you can
filter by the company that might have
posted the job the job type if the job
is an on-site or remote you can filter
by location a job function like there's
so many different filters you need to
apply you can even filter by salary I
want you to filter the crap out of your
ideal job title Okay now what's going to
happen is once I apply those filters
then I go through and I choose what
filters I want applied I want you to
notice that I now have 27 okay so I went
from 200 and some odd thousand jobs to
now just 27. now this is totally
workable right doesn't that sound so
much more doable than trying to sort
through those 200 and yada yada this is
a perfect amount this is where I'm going
to be like okay I see the light at the
end of the tunnel and I'm gonna go line
by line through these 27 jobs or even if
it's 10 I get to the top 10 and I'm
going to apply for those positions the
next thing you're going to do is you're
going to refresh your screen and it's
going to give you basically some new
recommended job titles after we get that
we want to go in and we want to take a
look at our job alerts so I'm going to
go to my job alerts Tab and it's going
to show me my job and I can edit this or
I can delete it if I don't want to have
that job alert anymore now the next
thing I want you to keep in mind if I
click on the edit or the manage my job
alert I can tell LinkedIn how how often
do I want to be notified daily weekly do
I want to be notified through email
through email and notification what how
do I want to be notified okay then I'm
going to save that's just us managing
once you save and you go back to that
job alerts tab I want you to select job
recommendations if you can put that job
job recommendations toggle toggle it on
that's then where you're going to get a
nice list of recommended jobs for you
and not random jobs that you're like uh
like I don't want I'm not going to apply
for that job why is LinkedIn
recommending me this job now keep in
mind you guys that recommended list
is going to be based on your job alerts
based on your activity based on your
profile that's why your profile needs to
be totally optimized once you get that
and you save your job alert you're going
to start getting emails that look just
like this it's going to say hey you have
a job alert created for blah blah blah
in the United States or whatever country
you set that alert for and you're going
to go through and you're gonna say oh
yeah every day I'm getting these alerts
will that position at Netflix or PayPal
looks awesome I'm gonna go apply for
those right now now here's the cool
thing about these emails too is it
showing you your connections that work
there so if we go back to that template
I just gave you you're not only going to
apply but you're also going to send your
connection a message what job title will

Forget about Twitter, Instagram and Facebook Linkedin is where the money is
Linkedin is the biggest business to business social network in the world.
So if you want to be there and you want to be successful on Linkedin than it's important
that you have a good Linkedin profile.
In order to have a good profile we want to review 3 key factors.
First thing is your profile picture.
Your profile picture is very important because on the basis of your profile picture people
will want to connect to you or offer you business proposals or maybe offer you a job.
Now, if you don't have a profile picture or if it's outdated than you really have to work
on that.
What do you need to have a good profile picture?
Well, first thing is that is has to be close up.
Look into the camera, smile, have a neutral background and dress appropriately, wearing
minimal jewellery and accessories and certainly no headwear or no sunglasses.
These are things to avoid in your profile picture.
Like shades This picture could work on Instagram but it's
not really suitable for Linkedin.
Ok, this one.
No explanation needed I think, no alcohol ever.
These are actually existing profile pictures that I found on Linkedin.
Ok, this one taken in a car, not looking in the camera, bad lighting.
The guy with the big cigar.
And this lady probably somewhere on holiday.
Now these pictures could work on Instagram but they are not really suitable for Linkedin
because you need a professional look on Linkedin.
So how do you know that your profile picture is good?
You could ask colleagues or maybe friends but there's another thing that you can do
and that's to use Photofeeler.com Now Photofeeler.com is an application, it's
a free one It's online and what it does is that professionals
like you and me they review your picture on the basis of three criteria: likability, influence
and competence.
Now let me give you an example, so here it is.
I logged in my existing Linkedin profile and you can see people rate my picture as very
competent and influential but as you can see I'm not considered very likeable.
So what I did I uploaded another picture where you see me smiling more.
And as you can see likability has improved but not dramatically but my competence and
influence have dropped.
So I decided to stick to my original picture because to me on Linkedin having an image
of being competent and influential is far more important that being likable.
So Photofeeler.com try it, use it and update your picture.
Now, another thing that you can do is to also update your background picture on Linkedin
because few people do that.
And standard, by default you have like this blueish background image which is a little
bit boring So you can update that.
And it''s really easy and it really helps you to get and even more professional look
on Linkedin.
So let me give you an example of a background picture
For instance here"s an example of Tara Hunt.
She's a market researcher and strategist and she communicates that perfectly is this great
background picture.
So make it work for you.
Second thing you want to do is to have a look at your headline.
Your headline is the piece of text that comes below your name.
And your headline you have to see that as an ad as the tile of an ad.
It has to you know draw the people in to your profile and make them want to read more about
you.
Now per default Linkedin uses your job title there.
There's nothing wrong with that but sometimes that can be a little bit boring.
Like marketing assistant or sales manager or whatever.
So there's a simple rule that you can use to enhance to make your title better on Linkedin.
And that's to use your job function and company name + most important keywords + Zing factor.
Now let me explain that.
Of course you have your job title and then your company name but it' also very important
to ad the important keywords.
Now why is that,?
Because when people go on Linkedin they often try to find certain profiles.
They use the search option to find certain profiles.
Now think of the keywords that people would use to find you and incorporate those in your
title.
For instance if you are a marketing manager or a marketing professional and you have experience
with SEO or e-mail marketing then it's important to use those words SEO and e-mail marketing
in your title.
And then the Zing factor.
That's something that surprises people, that could be a conversation starter, that explains
a little bit more what you stand for.
It's something to get attention with.
Let's have a look at an example.
This is the headline in my profile Communication trainer, coach and partner at
Expert Academy.
I included the most important keywords: like trainer and coach and communication and also
my company Expert Academy.
And then the zing is: Helping people in their professional growth
Here's another great headline from Tim Queen.
He managed to get all the important keywords in the headline and make it attractive and
teasing.
Marketing and Branding Strategist, Keynote Speaker, Youtuber and Founder.
Now the third thing you want to do is to write a strong summary.
The summary is the piece of text that you can find below your title.
In your summary you can explain what your skills are, what your strengths are.
For instance if you are a sales manager, then you can explain in your summary how you can
help other people, how you can help businesses to grow or what solutions you can offer to
them.
Also in your summary you can add social proof.
Now that is very very strong.
You can add links to you website, to a blog, a slide share and you can even add youtube
videos there.
And it's very easy to do, it's super easy.
Let me show you how it works.
Here is my summary and as you can see I have a link to my web page here and a link to a
Youtube video.
So when you click here people can watch the Youtube video inside the Linkedin application.
Adding external media is super easy.
Just click the pencil here to edit your profile.
Scroll down to the summary section and there you have the upload buttons for files and
links.
So let's say we want to link to a Youtube video, just paste the link here and as you
can see you get the preview and you can change the title and the description if you want.
Ok, so here's an extra bonus.
If you want you can leave the link to your Linkedin profile in the comments here below
and then I'll be happy to review it and have a look at your profile and to give you some
feedback and some tips on how to improve it.
Just leave the link to your Linkedin profile here below.

In this video, I show you how to use #LinkedIn to connect like a pro! You’ll see sample LinkedIn connection requests that have impressed even me, and you’ll be able to craft your own request message template.

84% of people find jobs using a “weak” relationship, and in the 21st century, LinkedIn is arguably the most powerful platform to effectively connect with these “weak” connections.

Through the three tips I mention, you will learn to connect with someone on LinkedIn without knowing the person either for a job, or just to expand your professional network! I’ll teach you how to adhere to LinkedIn connection request etiquette (super important!) and you might even be able to connect on LinkedIn without viewing the profile first!

People are often faced with the challenge of connecting with others on LinkedIn without really knowing them beforehand or without a proper introduction; but you will soon see you are able to message someone on LinkedIn who is not a connection (for free) and write custom, thoughtful messages that get an engaged response.

- A close friend is good for a lot of things,
but helping you find a new opportunity
isn't one of them.
According to one of the most influential
research papers on sociology,
84% of respondents got their job
through a "weak" relationship, myself included.
In this video,
I show you three LinkedIn tips you can use today
to connect with relevant LinkedIn professionals,
you have a "weak" relationship with,
but who are more likely to help you
than your close connections
in getting your next job.
So, let's get started.
Hi, everyone, it's Jeff from Google.
If you're new here,
this channel's all about practical career
and interview tips.
So if you're a current student or young professional
consider subscribing for more actionable content.
I'm living proof that the strength of weak ties,
a concept first explored by Mark Granovetter from Stanford,
is a real thing.
His research revolved around the idea
that people whom you spend a lot of time with
swim in the same pool of information as you do.
So, we depend on friendly outsiders
to bring us information beyond our immediate circles,
which makes a lot of sense.
My buddy at Akash,
who's an amazing human being
helped me land a job at Google four years ago.
And although we're tight now,
or at least I think so,
Tip 1 - Use Filter feature to find relevant Alumni
back then we were acquaintances at best.
So, how do you find these useful "weak" connections
on LinkedIn and more importantly,
get them to help you land a new one opportunity.
Tip number one,
use a Filter feature to find alumni
working in specific fields.
Connecting with a fellow alumni as a no brainer,
but make sure to take it a step further
by being very purposeful in your search.
If you go to the LinkedIn page of your college,
you then click the alumni button
to see everything one who has associated their profile
with the school,
yes, they're all your alumni,
and you already had that in common with them,
but instead of blindly sending requests to everyone,
you can use a filter feature to narrow your search.
There are three ways to use this search field.
Number one,
you already know the general field you wanna be in,
and you wanna find someone who's more experienced
or knowledgeable,
so, you can learn more from them.
Let's say, you know, you want to be in sales.
Then you might wanna type in account manager
in the search field,
and LinkedIn will output a list of alumni
who have account manager in their current title,
or in their previous job experiences.
The second way to use a search field,
is when you want to learn more about a position and company,
and you wanna connect with someone who is familiar
with the role that you're applying for.
Let's say you're in retail
and applying for a marketing position at Nike.
In that case, you'll type in Nike marketing,
separated by a comma,
and you'll see a list of alumni
who are currently working at or have worth at Nike.
Finally, if you're looking for inspiration,
or just generally curious,
as to where your fellow alumni have ended up,
you can click to expand where their work section,
to see the companies with the most alumni from your school.
Pro tip, this filter feature
works for company alumni as well.
Simply go to your company page
and click on People to run similar filters
Tip 2 - Message anyone on LinkedIn for free
to and even more relevant connections.
Have you found this first tip helpful?
Let me know by dropping a like and commenting down below
which industry you wanna learn more about
using this feature.
Tip number two,
anyone on LinkedIn without being directly connected to them.
As you probably know,
you're only able to message someone directly on LinkedIn,
if they're a first degree connection,
or if you have a premium account.
Fortunately for us,
the LinkedIn Groups feature
provide us with a small loophole.
For example, if I go to the EY group,
a group I'm part of
because I used to work at Ernst and young,
I can click the See All button here
and message any one of them
without being connected beforehand.
So, if I wanted to apply to Accenture,
I might just message this person right here directly.
Of course, this only works if you're already in the group,
if you're a current student,
I highly recommend you join your school's official group
and any related alumni groups.
If you're a working professional
and you wanna branch out to other areas,
I definitely don't recommend you disguise yourself
as another company's employee,
but rather join a group where you share similar interests
and background with existing members.
For example, for me,
I might search up product marketing in groups,
and request to join this group
I see a few of my first degree connections are already in.
Hopefully the admin will see my current role
is in product marketing and approve my request,
and then I'll be able to network and connect
with product marketers who have since moved on
to other roles I may be interested in.
Pro tip, other than using the group to message people
you're not yet connected to,
you can also post a request for career advice,
but be specific about what you're looking for.
For example, I recently saw a post
from a current senior at Emory University
saying that given the whole COVID situation,
he's very interested in pursuing a career
in business continuity consulting,
a very niche field of consulting,
and what classes he should take to prepare beforehand.
And within 24 hours,
he got multiple responses from alumni,
even though it's a very niche vertical.
And guess what?
He's just expanded his network by posting this question,
because if he follows up with those alumni,
Tip 3 - Write custom and thoughtful messages
he'll probably end up learning about specific opportunities.
By the way, I have a community of my own,
a Facebook group where I post exclusive weekly tips.
Consider joining if you haven't already
I'll link it down below.
Tip number three,
connect by sending out custom thoughtful request.
So, whether you're connecting with someone
you found through tip one,
or messaging someone directly via tip two,
you wanna craft a thoughtful message
in order to get an engaged response.
In my experience,
three types of messages help you leave a strong impression
on the other person.
Number one, you write something relatable.
Number two, you compliment them.
Number three, you try and add value.
If you look at this message I received a few weeks ago,
"Hi, Jeff came across your Q and A video on YouTube,
"I've really enjoyed learning about career trajectory,
"especially about the EdTech from management consulting part
"I'm an Education student,
"interest in exploring opportunities in consulting.
"Would love to stay connected."
So not only do I feel good she watched my YouTube video.
But she mentioned something very specific from that video
and relates her career directory to mine.
Or take this other example from a high school friend
who I haven't caught up with up until a month ago.
"Jeff, been viewing your videos on YouTube,
"hope you keep up the good work,
"sending you greetings from Korea.
"Also a thought.
"I think you could also try content on LinkedIn
"and job searching.
"Tried and true topic, see if your audience likes it."
If you're watching this video,
you know that I took his advice.
He didn't come off as a nodder,
but as someone who genuinely wants to help me
and he definitely has.
Bonus tip
Pro tip, if you're using a LinkedIn app on mobile,
you have to click the More and Personalized invite
to send a custom connection requests.
So, definitely don't use the default Connect button.
Finally, you wanna make sure your LinkedIn profile
is ready to passively receive traffic
when these people check you out before they respond.
So, make sure you check out my LinkedIn profile video
as well to fully optimize your LinkedIn presence
before sending out those connection requests.
For example, one of my tips was to use free online tools
to create a more professional profile picture
and LinkedIn banner.
After following the step-by-step instructions,
one of our viewers, Connor, actually took it a step further
and added his own tagline to his new and improved banner.
This is the before, and this is the after.
Ending
As you can see, he states his value proposition
in a concise and easy to understand way
to grab the attention
of potential employers and clients.
And there you have it.
Three practical tips you can use today
to leverage your weak connections on LinkedIn.
Of course, if you find success with this,
don't forget to pay it forward
when someone reaches out to you as well.
I hope this video helped,

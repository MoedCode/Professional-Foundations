We have finally reached this moment that you have all been eagerly waiting for, so it is worth repeating…

Your tech tracks officially begin on Monday, 18 November.

You’ve been waiting so long for this, and we’re so excited that it’s almost here.

As you take time to recoup and attend the hub festivities over the next 3 weeks, please remember to keep your eyes out for email communications on how to access your new course experiences. Each track is different and specific detailed instructions will be shared with you.

We are so proud of you for reaching this point!

# Optional] Self Reporting Form
As mentioned in Month 1, one of the ways in which we manage to keep the programs at ALX fully sponsored is by sharing accurate placement information with our sponsors. They rely on this data to measure impact and define future sponsorship.



We ask that you complete this survey if

Your current employment/professional status has changed, i.e., you have found a job or changed roles in your company.
Your answers will help keep us up to date with your progress and the ALX dream alive. You are the future of Africa, and by updating us on your employment status when you land a job, you:

Open the door for another ALX learner to start their journey
Help us redefine what being a young African leader means by celebrating you and your place in the world.
Please ensure you complete the survey if you still need to complete it. We want to foster a culture of checking in. This is a required part of your learning and will only take you between 5 and 20 minutes to complete.

Thanks in advance for your participation, and we look forward to you continuing this journey of Doing Hard Things together.

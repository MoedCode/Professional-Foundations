# Video Production Tools
Last week, you and you team created your pitch presentation. This week you you have the option to pitch your presentation via a recorded video, and enter the[ Team Project Showcase](https://forms.gle/T3HnrYhcF7zj4u99A). That means – in addition to having accurate data, crafting a powerful message, creating a compelling slide deck and finding the perfect pitch, pace and tone – you will need to understand how to do it all as a recorded video.

As you would have guessed, recording a presentation is different to vlogging or film recording, as your focus will be on both you and your deck. That normally means providing a clear screen recording of your presentation slides with you powerfully talking through them.

Thanks to technology, there are various tools you can use to create recorded video presentations. In this lesson, we talk about two instruments – Loom and Zoom – that we enjoy using for video recordings. We have only chosen two as these are easy to use and popular.

As you watch both videos, think about the following:

Which platform would serve your team best? (You will discuss this as a team to make a final decision.)
The various setting requirements and considerations for each platform.
Loom (our favourite tool)

//  ABOUT VEENA V //

Hello Happiness Hustler! I'm Veena V and I started working in the media industry when I was 16. After 10 years of working as a radio presenter, having a baby when I was 22, becoming a single mum, and getting frustrated with always 'chasing' work, I was fed up!

So I decided to change my life and to set up my own Youtube Training Business. After helping thousands of business owners to get confident on camera, I realised that many people struggle with fear of judgment and low self-esteem. That's why I am now currently training as a hypnotherapist to help people change their own lives and turn their dreams into a reality.

```txt
woohoo all right hello my beautiful
happiness hustler and today i'm going to
teach you how to use zoom
to record your presentation okay
and make sure you follow this tutorial
step by step
it's really important you do that
because um anyway i'll stop talking here
let's go over to my computer and i'll
explain more to you over there
okay so we are on my computer as you can
see now this step is really important
and you've got to do it first okay
is actually bring up your presentation
so this presentation i've made on my
computer so i've got a mac
and i made it in um keynote so that's a
free app
on mac now if you don't have a mac i'm
sure there's some free softwares on your
laptop
or you can come to my favorite thing
i don't know why i said it in that voice
um but it's this it's called
canva.com and i literally make
everything in canva it's absolutely free
to use there is a paid version with more
features
but in the free version you can actually
scroll down here and look
it actually lets you make a presentation
okay
so whether you make your presentation on
your computer in powerpoint
or um on canva and do it for free here
um once you've got your presentation
you've got to make sure you have loaded
it up on your computer so i
simply clicked on my file and i've
opened it
up now the next thing you do is sign
into your zoom
account if you're watching this and
you're like oh no
i don't have a zoom account yet on the
screen right now
popping up is a link for you to go and
watch my full
zoom tutorial for beginners that will
literally take you
from a to zed okay so go and watch that
video
if you haven't signed up for zoom yet if
you've got your zoom account let's go on
to the next step
and it's simply to open up zoom so
my zoom is down here if you've got a
zoom account
make sure you're downloading the app
onto your computer because it makes it
so much more easier and quicker
every time i want to start a meeting i
simply go bang
and open open it up this way okay so
we're going to click on
zoom down here now what i'm going to do
is click
on new meeting
right now i'm going to make sure i'm
unmuted
which i am here um if someone can't hear
you is because you're muted so you just
simply click
on there so i'm going to unmute myself
then i'm going to click on start
video yay there we go
if you don't want your video on the
screen as you're doing the presentation
you can just click it off okay so click
on that button
off there if you've clicked on start
video
and you still can't see yourself click
on this arrow
and then make sure you're connected to
the right
webcam so if i click on this one it's
going to go dark now
and you can't see me because i'm using
an external
webcam so just make sure you check your
settings as well
so there we go now you're going to see
why that first step was really important
by loading
up our presentation on our screen
because now we're going to click
on share screen this is how we're going
to start
presenting our presentation on zoom
so click on share screen and now we want
to click
on what we want to share so i don't want
to share my desktop
i don't want to go on the whiteboard i
want to share
my presentation so i'm going to click on
that option and then click on
share and there we go this is what it's
going to look like okay
so this is what my attendees
of my zoom meeting are going to see
they're going to see my presentation
on the screen and i'm going to be up in
the corner as you can see
right now um now if you want to
stop sharing can you see up here you
simply
press stop maybe you want to pause it
because maybe i don't know you need to
go into the toilet or go and do
something
you can also pause it as well you can
also do things like annotating so i can
um write another text here so if
someone's asked a question on my
presentation
i could maybe say i don't know well done
or something on top
do you see and this is all in the free
version of
zoom as well and you can have a little
uh
mess around with that up here let me
just clear that
clear all drawings so what i usually do
let me just to get rid of that thing
menu bar we just click on the x
um but when i'm sharing my screen and
doing a presentation
i don't usually use any of those tools
but that may be handy
if you teach students um
or you're running some kind of class or
training and you want to highlight
things on the screen or circle things
as well remember as well oh let me
resume that
um remember as well if i don't know
i've got a child okay and i don't really
like anyone seeing him
on my youtube videos or my zoom calls
so if that happens to you and there's
someone that comes in the room
you can quickly as you're presenting
your presentation
you can quickly go up here and go and
stop video
and then what happens is you can still
continue
to click on your presentation and go
through it um but no one can see you now
okay and if you want to put your video
back up
we'll just go on start video
so i'm going to um stop share
for a minute actually no let's keep this
going now
what i usually do is before i start
talking i would have clicked record
now if you were like me and you forgot
to click record
what you can do is click on the more
option at the top and you can click
record i'm not going to do that because
it's going to slow down
my whole computer because i'm also
recording from a separate software
but if you wanted to record your meeting
and record the presentation
you can click on the record button
there you can also
see the chat box excuse me so
again for example maybe you're teaching
a class you're going through
all of this stuff like yeah this is how
you get ten thousand followers
subscribers on youtube
now as i glance to my right i can also
see people typing in questions
here as well so again if you are
recording this presentation and you're
delivering it on zoom
you can get people to see you because
i've left my webcam on
people can see the screen and you can
also
see the comments and questions coming in
by clicking on on more and then the chat
option okay now say we've come to the
end of the presentation no and what you
need to do is click
on stop share and there we go
and i'll show you the option as well so
usually
like i said once i start my meeting my
presentation i will click on record
first okay and you might want to send
that recording
um to someone that's missed your
presentation or your class
via zoom okay so we've done our
presentation de la de la da
we've stopped the share screen and this
is the part where we say
bye to all of our students um
before i do that i really hope you've
enjoyed this tutorial
if you have don't forget to subscribe to
this channel because i've got so
many more videos on the way for you my
name is veena v
nice to meet you and i make video easy
so you can focus on your purpose passion
and making a profit
go and watch that video next that
is a full playlist all about zoom
so if you want an in-depth tutorial go
from a to z how to use zoom
if you want to know how to look more
professional
on zoom as well you want to know about
lighting and different equipment that i

on my channel and then the last thing
we're going to do
we're going to say goodbye and by doing
that you press
end down there i'll see you in the next
video
```
question mark
Something to consider:

What other tools can you use to record compelling presentations?
Take a moment to search the web to see what options are out there for you. Easy examples are Teams and Google Meet. What else is out there?
Now that you know how to record your pitch, let’s talk about editing it to remove the parts you don’t want, and create a more polished final video, later in the module. But first! Some tips to make your recordings look more professional.

# Video Recording Considerations


Because we are all about setting you up for success, we’ve created a simple worksheet that breaks down the recording of a presentation into smaller actionable steps. It will also get you thinking about other aspects of presentation recording, e.g., lighting, noise levels, and professional attire.

You can find the video recording [worksheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LZ43h3P1HNyJag6wORj6dTTlZam4pAG2f_9puxnBj_0/copy).

    Bucket	Action item/Deliverables (add as many action items as needed by your team)
    Slides	Complete presentation and have final version ready for recording
    Message	Complete your presentation outline and have your powerful message ready.
    Message	Final review of your presentation outline
    Tech planning 	Decide on the Recording App that you will use (e.g Zoom or Loom)
    Tech planning	Choose a professional outfit to wear for the video recording.
    Tech planning	Choose a suitable professional background that you will use fo your recording.
    Tech planning	Select a venue that provides adequate light and minimal background noise.
    Tech planning	Secure any other props, if any, need by the team for the pitch video.
    Tech planning 	Test your microphone and video to ensure they are both working well several days before the pitch video shooting.
    Presenting 	Practice your voice pitch, pace, tone and body language.
    Tech check	Check that you have everything you need. Consider doing a quick run-through recording to see how it looks.
    Film	Actually record your video
    Check video	Watch your video and decide if you'd like to re-shoot it.
    Reshoot/re-do	Re-record your video as many times as you need to get something you feel happy with.
    Share with team	Share the link to the unedited video with your teammates to get feedback before editing begins.
    Edit (optional)	If you need to remove some unwanted part of the video, you can edit it using a video editing app.
    Share with team	Share the final video with each team member
    Upload	Upload your video to your personal YouTube as "unlisted". Copy the url and paste it to a new Google Doc. Clearly label the doc so you can find it later; it will form part of your Milestone 4 Submission.

Make a personal copy and keep it handy as you will use it for your pitch preparation.

Here are 2 quick tips:
If you want a video of you to show alongside your presentation, then video conferencing etiquette applies.
If you only want to show your on-screen presentation, with your camera off, then your focus would be on minimal background noise, quality sound and screen recording.
For your pitch video, you are required to show yourself while presenting so please remember that video conferencing etiquette applies.

# This optional activity is specifically designed for the team members responsible for the following, for those team that wish to enter the Team Project Showcase:

Tracking the video recording checklist to making sure the team has all it needs to successfully record the pitch video.
Doing the talking in the video (the presenters).

That being said, this is high-stakes and all learners must study the activity and familiarize themselves with the listed criteria and requirements for the pitch video. This will enable you to effectively contribute, review and assess the recorded video against each of these criteria.

Remember, this video will represent you and your teammate’s work for Month 2. So, even if you are not directly involved in creating the video recording, your participation in studying the activity and supporting your teammates is a must.



Roles responsible for leading this activity:

Video Recording Maestro - Tech Guru and recording maestros are always welcomed in a tech course. This teammate will ensure the team is ready and all set for the video recording day at the Hub. They are responsible for checking items off the [video recording checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LZ43h3P1HNyJag6wORj6dTTlZam4pAG2f_9puxnBj_0/copy).

    Bucket	Action item/Deliverables (add as many action items as needed by your team)
    Slides	Complete presentation and have final version ready for recording
    Message	Complete your presentation outline and have your powerful message ready.
    Message	Final review of your presentation outline
    Tech planning 	Decide on the Recording App that you will use (e.g Zoom or Loom)
    Tech planning	Choose a professional outfit to wear for the video recording.
    Tech planning	Choose a suitable professional background that you will use fo your recording.
    Tech planning	Select a venue that provides adequate light and minimal background noise.
    Tech planning	Secure any other props, if any, need by the team for the pitch video.
    Tech planning 	Test your microphone and video to ensure they are both working well several days before the pitch video shooting.

Pitch Video Presenters - These are the fearless speakers, proficient presenters and charismatic communicators. The number of people who speak in the video will be up to your team but – to maintain impact and your audience’s focus on your key message – we recommend 1 to 2 people at most to do the speaking.
What To Do
1. Review your team’s [Video Preparation Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LZ43h3P1HNyJag6wORj6dTTlZam4pAG2f_9puxnBj_0/copy)
to ensure that you have completed all the required tasks in the blue and purple sections before recording.

2. Make sure you have your team’s final presentation speech outline and slide deck open. These are the documents that will guide your pitch.

3. Begin recording the pitch video.

You can add additional creative elements, but your video must meet the following minimum requirements:

A. The duration should be a minimum of 2 minutes and a maximum of 3 minutes.

B. The audio should be clear and easy to understand, at an appropriate volume.

C. The video should provide a clear on-screen recording of your presentation.

D. The presenter must use the final team presentation outline as a guide during the video.

E. The video must include a video of the final team slide deck, with accompanying narration.

F. If your solution is a 3D Prototype, include video footage or photos of the prototype.

G. If your solution involves Wireframes, include images of each screen from the wireframes.

H. Ensure that the presenter’s camera is on, displaying their face in one of the corners of the screen for the audience to see.

4. Review the video and make a list of things the video editor will need to do to finalize the recording. Your list should include:

All the areas that need to be cut out for the video. You can do this using the time stamp for that particular video. For example: “Cut out from 1 minute 24 seconds to 2 minutes 3 seconds”. This can be simply written as “Remove 1:24 - 2:03”.
The places you need to highlight simple text in the video. For instance, you might want to add the Team member names and presenter names at the beginning of the video, or you might want to highlight a certain point on the screen.
5. Upload your video on Google Drive or YouTube and share the link with your entire team. They also need to see the video before the editing starts so they can make recommendations and add them to your list for the editor.

# Editing Your Video
As with almost every video recording, there will be parts that you want to edit out and remove from your final product.

If you record your video presentation using our favourite tool, Loom, then the video editing can be done on the same app. Study this next article to learn how to trim, cut or remove unwanted parts of a video.

How to trim and stitch your Loom video

In addition to Loom, there are other easy-to-use video editing apps you can use. These include iMovie if you use a Mac and Clipchamp if you are on Windows. The apps generally work in the same way to trim, stick or delete a part of a video. This 4-minute tutorial will get you clued on how to quickly edit your video to remove any unwanted parts.



Pretty simple right? Okay, now that we know the basics it’s time to put our skills into action.

How To Cut In iMovie + Trim & Delete! 🔥 [Edit Any Video With These 3 Edits!]
```
***Transcript***:
```txt
in this video i'm going to show you how
you can cut trim
and delete in imovie let's get started
okay guys so when it comes to using
imovie you can pretty much edit
an entire video with just these three
simple kind of techniques
and that is trim cut and delete
so the first command i'm going to show
you is how to
cut a clip so right here i have an
example video that i've just imported
into imovie so to start cutting a
particular video
all you have to do is click on the video
itself until it's highlighted in yellow
and then you want to bring the cursor to
the particular part of the video
that you would like to cut so i can zoom
in a little bit here so it's
kind of easier to see so i want to cut
the video right here in this kind of
little valley of audio here
so i can bring the cursor here click
there and then i can go
and right click on the video so right
here we have a few different options
that we can select
so what i want to click on is split clip
which is also known for cutting the clip
so i can just go and select that one and
that will go
and take that one video and and divide
it into
two videos that we can then reorganize
trim and add new effects to
as well so if you're looking to really
speed up the process maybe you have a
really long video and you're looking to
um kind of cut various bits of the video
another really quick way on how you can
do this is by clicking
command b and that will also allow you
to do the same prompt
so again i can go to this part of the
video
select it and then go command b and that
will again go
and cut that part of the video so the
next thing i'm going to show you guys is
how to trim
a particular clip so right here we have
this clip that we just cut on either end
and i'm actually looking to trim this
um just to make it a little bit more
concise in the video that i'm making
so to trim all you have to do is click
on the
particular video so i can click on this
one in the middle until it's highlighted
in yellow and then all i have to do is
take my mouse cursor
and either bring it to the front or the
back of the video
and i'll do this on the back and as you
can see guys as i'm getting towards the
back of this particular clip
we now have this icon with two arrows
symbolized
so simply all i have to do is click and
hold
and bring this to the left and that will
allow me to trim
that particular clip as well and then i
can also go
and do the same for the other side so
again we're getting those icons so i can
click and hold
and drag that one as well so now we have
a trimmed clip um in the middle of the
video
and now what i'm going to do is show you
how to delete part of a video so say for
example
um towards the end i made a mistake on
the video
so i can easily go and delete that
particular part of the video
so again to do this i can go select that
one
click into there and click command b
which was the shortcut that we used just
before
and then i can go and zoom in again and
click here
and again command b and right here we
have
this particular video so i can click on
this one make sure it's highlighted and
then simply press the delete button on
your keyboard
and that will remove that particular
clip as well
and also you can do that for any video
within this as well
so say for example i wanted to delete
the introduction
i can go and do that one as well and if
you've made a mistake at any point
during editing any of these clips all
you have to do to
undo a change is go and press command z
and that will bring back um that deleted
clip and i can also do the same
to bring back that one as well but i'm
going to leave that as is as i'm now
happy um with those particular edits but
there you have it guys those are three
really simple kind of techniques that
will allow you to edit
an entire video from start to finish um
with just
trimming cutting and deleting so there
you have it guys
um hopefully this video has been helpful
for you if there's any other videos
you'd like me to make then please drop a
comment down below
and i'll be more than happy to help you
guys out so as always thanks for
watching i'll see you all
in the next one

# [Optional] Team Online Activity: Edit Your Video
This optional activity is specifically designed for the team members who will be editing the pitch video, to remove any unwanted parts or add any elements that the team wants as part of the video. Again, this is optional for those teams that wish to enter the Team Project Showcase.

It is important for all team members to study this section and familiarize themselves with the various elements of the final team slide deck. By doing so, every team member will be well-informed and able to provide valuable feedback during the slides review process.

Even if you are not directly involved in developing the video, you are required to collaborate effectively with your team and provide constructive feedback based on the video preparation guidelines in the content.



To our video editing stars- Your team will need a Post-Production Prodigy to polish up the video after the Hub session. This requires very basic editing skills to cut and stitch videos together and add text to the screen if your team chooses to. You don’t have to be a pro at this, we have shared some guidelines as part of the content, and YouTube is also your best friend for quick DIY videos on simple video editing.

What To Do
1. Find an app that you would like to use to edit your video. We recommend simple ones like iMovie if you are using Apple, or Clipchamp if you are on Windows.

(If you record the video in Loom and you are also the same person editing it you can do the editing in Loom)

All the above options are free for basic video editing.

2. Using the list of edits provided by the video presenter, pitch video maestro and your team, make the edits to the video as required.

3. Once done, save the final version and share the link with the team. Every team member must have access to the final video so they can share any final thoughts.

4. One round of edits should be more than enough but just in case there is something that needs fixing after the first round, update the video and share the link to the most up-to-date version with the team.

5. You must make sure that all team members have access to the final pitch video, so that they can review it.

6. Once you’re comfortable with your final product, you can do the following:

Upload the video to YouTube, and get a shareable link. Make sure the video isn’t set to “private” and can be viewed by anyone with the link.
Submit the link for the showcase by filling out this survey.

There can only be ONE ENTRY PER TEAM. Any duplicate entries will be deleted. Entries must be received by the end of Next Week


Yes, it is. Nice Job!

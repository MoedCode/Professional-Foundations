# Understanding Your Users
Next week you and your team will complete your initial prototype or set of wireframes that showcase the basic functionality of your proposed solution. This means you need to gather user information to build the best solution that works for the people most affected by your selected problem. Therefore, you are required to conduct at least 1 user interview to get to know the problem and the user’s pain points better. You can ask your fellow learners as long as they are not part of your team.

You will conduct brief user interviews with them to better understand how people might engage with your solution and to gain insight into how your solution could be implemented or designed.

In this module, we will explore how user interviews work. We will also provide insights that you can use to gear up and run successful user interviews later this week!

Let’s dig in!
# Preparing for a User Interview

(Maybe he should have said, “I’m not good at planning things out… [YET](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/103011).”)
##  The Power of Yet

    When we add the word “yet,” to a statement about our abilities – for example, “I am not good at statisticsyet.” or “I don’t know how to repair a refrigeratoryet.” – it reminds us that our intelligence and knowledge are fluid and can grow. It reminds us that if we put in time and effort, we can learn more, develop more skills, and become better at things.This mindset is critical for our success!

    What’s something you’re not particularly good at?

    Now say out loud, “I’m not good at …….. yet.”

    How did that feel?

Being the organized tech leader that you are becoming, it is so important to plan ahead and know what you will need to conduct effective user interviews.

Having a game plan before you start conducting interviews is a must. There will be a lot of moving parts and you must be organized enough to ensure nothing falls off the radar.

For this week’s user interviews, you must spend some time preparing. This preparation can happen in your teams first meeting (or asynchronously if you can’t twice). To do so successfully, you must:

Set a clear objective for your interviews. What do you want to understand further? What do you want to get out of the interview? Remember, your object must be SMART.

Create a list of interview questions that will help you understand your users’ needs, expectations, and pain points. Ensure that your questions are open-ended and provide valuable insights into your users’ thoughts and experiences.

You will need to ask your interviewees questions that help you better understand how your chosen problem impacts them. Please write out at least 4 questions that you could ask.

An example question is, “Tell me more about how lack of consistent electricity impacts your business.”

Define your target audience (community) and who you want to interview.

Develop a list of users who fit your target user group’s criteria and choose a few you want to interview.

There are other preparations that you will need to do before the actual interviews, to ensure you are ready e.g. confirming interviewee availability and securing the equipment that you will need. You must refer back to your [User Interview Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19xn3TCcxlf5prt7IBJUFUWHwAe3rCB-XGuxwBoAKJjw/copy) to confirm that you have planned everything that you need for your interviews.
[text](<Copy of User Interview Checklist - PF.xlsx>)
There are other considerations you will need to make like, how to actually find participants to interview. Let’s talk about that a little.

Before the interview:

FALSE	Identify the research goals and objectives
FALSE	Create a list of open-ended questions that will help you achieve the research goals
FALSE	Define the target audience and user persona
FALSE	Recruit participants who fit your target audience and user persona
FALSE	Schedule the interview time and date
FALSE	Confirm the participants' availability
FALSE	Prepare a consent form and any other necessary paperwork
FALSE	Choose a suitable location for the interview or decide on a remote interview platform
FALSE	Set up any necessary equipment, such as a recording device or camera

During the interview:
FALSE	Introduce yourself and the purpose of the interview
FALSE	Obtain the participant's consent to record the interview (if applicable)
FALSE	Make the participant feel comfortable and at ease
FALSE	Ask open-ended questions and follow-up questions to clarify the participant's responses
FALSE	Listen actively and show interest in the participant's thoughts and opinions
FALSE	Take detailed notes during the interview
FALSE	Respect the participant's time and avoid going over the allotted time
FALSE	Thank the participant for their time and input

After the interview:
FALSE	Transcribe any audio or video recordings, if necessary
FALSE	Review your notes and identify any patterns or insights
FALSE	Analyze the data collected from the interviews
FALSE	Summarize the key findings and insights from the interviews
FALSE	Share the findings and insights with the team or stakeholders
FALSE	Use the insights to inform design decisions and iterate on the product or service

# Choosing Interviewees
So – in the real world – where do you find users and how do you ensure you end up with the right set of interviewees?
As guided by United Nations University, the common (and simplest) method for selecting participants for focus groups is called “purposive” or “convenience” sampling. This means that you select those members of the community who you think will provide you with the best information. It need not be a random selection as that may be unhelpful.

For example, if you are investigating why fitness app users do not always follow guidelines provided by the app, it would seem more “convenient” and more useful to select the users of the app and people interested in fitness. A random sample of the whole community may end up not providing you with actual app users or fitness fanatics.

So here is our special step-by-step guide on how to choose the right interviews.

Create a user persona: We talked about user personas in the previous weeks. Do you remember what they are? A user persona is a made-up individual who symbolizes your ideal user. By investigating the characteristics, objectives, motives, and pain points of your target users, you may develop a thorough user persona. This will assist you in establishing a list of requirements for choosing interviews.
Recruit participants: Once your research objectives have been established and a user persona has been developed, you may begin recruiting participants. There are many ways to find participants, including word-of-mouth, email, and social media.
Screen participants: Once possible participants have been found, you must screen them to make sure they meet the requirements for your user persona. A screening questionnaire can be used to learn more about a person’s demographics, product usage, and behaviour. To determine their fit, you can also do a quick phone or video interview.
Schedule interviews: Following the screening process, you can set up interviews with the participants. Make sure you provide participants with detailed directions on how to join the interview and what to anticipate. To make scheduling simpler, think about utilizing a program like Calendly. #CalendarManagement
This list of activities is not as simple as it looks particularly when conducting research that calls for a large number of users and broad demographics. The finding and recruiting can call for more resources. Ultimately, you want to interview people who are living the problem you’re trying to solve and will be able to provide the most details on all the factors influencing the issue.

Watch this next video that shares perspectives on 5 ways to recruit participants when the research is large-scale. As you watch make sure you can answer:

Have I understood each of the 5 recruiting strategies and the best time to use them.
Have I understood each strategy’s benefits and limitations?

Getting representative members of the target audience as your test participants is essential for user research validity. You can outsource recruiting to an agency, or do it yourself. Each method has its own advantages and possible biases.

***Transcript***:
```txt
Intro
So, you need user feedback.
While it might be tempting to post your prototypes
to LinkedIn and ask, "Which UI is better,"
that's not going to give you the best insights,
especially when the only people
who are likely to see your posts are professional colleagues
or friends who know a lot about what you do for a living,
and likely are not representative of your actual audience.
Professional recruiters
Instead, consider one of these five recruiting strategies
for your next research project.
First, professional recruiters.
While this is often the most costly option,
since you have to pay for incentives and recruiting fees,
professional recruiters often have
large pools of respondents,
so they can find both general audiences
with a good mix of genders, backgrounds,
financial status, age, et cetera,
as well as more specialized audiences.
They have experience administering
and even creating screening surveys to find ideal candidates
for even the most specialized studies.
So, they can offset a lot of the labor
that research teams may dedicate to recruitment.
However, you should still be clear with them
about your eligibility criteria,
and keep in mind that they will need additional time
to actually contact and schedule slots
with each participant.
But overall, the risk of a biased sample
will be relatively low,
though perhaps limited to local audiences
for in-person studies.
Number two, automated recruiting platforms.
Automated recruiting platforms
These platforms are often a bit cheaper,
since recruiting fees tend to be a bit lower,
but incentives must still be high enough
to attract participants.
These platforms often have a wide global reach
and since they are automated,
they enable researchers to outsource
some of the work of scheduling and contacting candidates.
However, screening surveys do need to be manually configured
and sometimes can be limited in their capabilities.
Turnaround time tends to be quicker, though,
because the screening survey is sent out
instantaneously and the risk of bias can sometimes be low
if the pool of respondents is well managed.
So this makes them a great option
for most studies with more general audiences.
Internal user feedback panels
Number three, internal user feedback panels.
These are often the cheapest option
since companies can usually compensate participants
in the form of discounted or free products or services.
And no recruitment fees are necessary
since participants can quickly be found
with a quick email blast or two.
However, the scheduling and screening
is left entirely up to the researcher,
and there's increased risk of bias
due to the fact that these folks don't represent
other users, like new or disgruntled users.
But if you're trying to learn about existing users,
power users, or employees,
this could be a great, inexpensive way
to get participants for your study.
Online forums and groups
Number four, online forums and groups.
The internet is a powerful tool,
and online forums or groups often promise publicity
and reach at little to no cost.
While posting to your own profiles is often unhelpful
for the reasons I mentioned before,
there can be a lot of opportunity in reaching out to forums
or groups with specialized user groups,
like people with disabilities,
people with specific interests,
or people in specific roles or industries.
However, researchers have to take on all the work
of screening, communicating,
and scheduling with participants,
making it a relatively high effort method
with some extra turnaround time needed.
Risk of bias can also be somewhat high,
since vocal group members
can sometimes sway popular opinions in the group,
but this can be avoided by sourcing participants
from multiple groups or forums.
Intercept studies
Finally, number five, intercept studies.
If you've ever run into a person or popup that asked,
"Would you like to participate
in a five minute survey,"
then you've probably encountered an invitation
to join an intercept study.
These studies can be done virtually or in person.
However, the reach of these studies
is limited to new or existing visitors
who have already decided to interact with a company,
or task oriented users who have a specific goal in mind.
The cost of these studies tends to be low
due to the lack of recruiting fees.
However, researcher effort can be very high
due to the need to be on call and essentially ready
for moderated studies,
even if no one has accepted the invitation yet.
The bias risk can be moderate
due to limiting your audience to current visitors.
But if the goal is to understand what a task oriented user
does or how visitors perceive your product or service,
then intercept studies can provide
very valuable user feedback.
Conclusion
So there you have it.
Five recruiting strategies to find great users
for your research.
Which method is right for you?
Well, there's no one size fits all approach
to recruiting participants.
Consider your study needs,
your budget, and how many researchers
you have available.
Just because you can't afford a professional recruiter
doesn't mean you can't facilitate user research.
It just means that the method
of recruiting that you choose
will have a trade off, and that's okay.
Some data is better than no data.
And if you're careful about managing research bias,
you'll end up with real data
and evidence to help guide you toward a great design.

# Types of User Interview Questions
Oftentimes, asking the right questions = knowing your users’ needs better. Just like this cat below. A designer thought this little Simba needed a fancy climbing tool. But he really just needed a box.



Preparing a user interview guide can help you ensure that the topics relevant to your research questions are considered and that the interview will capture in-depth information about your users’ lives and needs.

Rule of thumb: A good interview generally allows deep, free-flowing conversations with the person you are interviewing

Here are the types of questions you can prepare in your guide:

Question Type	Description
Open-Discovery
Examples:

“Tell me about…”

“Why do you…?”

“What are/ is…?”

“What… do you use/ do about?”

“Describe to me how you…/ your experience with…?”

“How often do you…”

“How much/ many…”

Understanding User Tasks/ Activities

Examples:

“How do you [task]…?” (Direct question)

“Describe how you would [task]?” (Indirect question)

“What are all the things you need to do and know in order to [task]?”

Sequential: “Walk me through the steps, how do you… [task]?”

Comparison: “What is the difference between [A] and [B]?”

Performing/ Showing
Examples:

“Show me how you [task]” (Asking them to perform the task, share their screen etc.)

Role-play: “Let’s pretend I’m your neighbour who knows nothing about [task]. Guide me so that I could do it myself afterwards.

Talking about Problems and Pain Points
Examples:

"How does this problem impact you?”

“How did you solve/ get around that issue?”

“What’s the hardest/ most frustrating part about…?”

“If you had a magic wand, what would you change?”

Opinions/ Points of View/Attitudes or Perceptions
Examples:

“What do you think about…?”

“What do you like/ dislike about…?”

“What would your friend/ partner/ colleague think of that?”

“Some people….., other……, what is your opinion on that?”

Recalling the Past & Anticipating the Future
Examples:

“Please recall a situation when you…, what did you do?”

“Tell me about your most significant/ memorable experience/ interaction with…?”

“How do you think… is going to help you?”

“Describe to me the ideal product/ experience….?”

Sentence Completion and Drawing
Examples:

“Can you draw your thought process on [ABC]…?”

“Complete the sentence: the best place to eat is….?”

# Consent Form


Even though your user interviews are likely to be short and simple, it is a best practice to always get a consent form from your participant before conducting any user interview.

Here is a simple consent form you can copy into a doc, print, and have each interviewee read and sign before you conduct your user interview:

I consent to participate in this research project.
The research may not be of direct benefit to me.
My participation is completely voluntary.
I have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any implications to me.
I agree to my interview being audio-recorded.
I understand that all information I provide for this study will be treated confidentially.
Signed:________________________
Date: __________________

# Team Activity: Conduct User Interviews

Steps 1 and 2 in your Milestone # 6 Worksheet are related to your team’s user interviews. Let’s clarify what is required!


Step 1: Interview Preparation
In this part, you’re required to provide information around your preparation for the user interviews. This means includes the following:

User persona: Identify the describe the user persona that you’re targeting to get more information about the problem that you’re going to solve. These should be in line with the people that your solution is ultimately going to serve. You completed this work as part of the [Defining Target User Activity](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/104565).
Interview questions: Provide the list of questions that intend to ask during the interview.
Step 2: Conduct User Interview and Gather Insights
Now that your team has completed the preparation for the user interviews, and you have your consent form ready, it’s time for you to conduct your interviews!

Remember:
You can ask your peers at the hub to serve as participants, as long as they are not team members.
Ideally, one team member should conduct the interview, and another should take notes. You should also record audio of the interview and listen immediately afterwards to see if there was anything you missed.
Each team must conduct at least 2 user interviews.
As you finalize your interviewees and interview them, make sure to take their full names and occupation. You’re going to record this information in Milestone # 6 Worksheet Step 3.

After your team has conducted at least 2 user interviews and you have their responses recorded. At least one member of your team, and ideally more, should review the notes and/or audio recordings to pull out the insights. Ask yourselves as a team:

On the whole, what was new that you learnt about your problem and its effect on people?
What were the most pressing concerns and pain points mentioned in the interviews?
What recommendations did you receive from the interviewees about possible solutions?
Did you uncover any new factors surrounding the problem that you didn’t consider before?
Next, you can prepare your answer to Milestone # 6, Step 2.

Please describe at least 3 pieces of insights that you received from your target users, and how they affect your understanding of the problem. Add your insights on the Milestone # 6 Worksheet.

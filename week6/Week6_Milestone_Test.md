ALX Professional Foundations (PF): Week #6 Milestone Worksheet
SECTION A: User Interview Preparation
Step 1: Restate your team’s problem statement
Please write your team’s agreed-upon problem statement from Week 6 here:

Step 1: My Team’s Problem Statement






Step 2: Define the User Persona
Define the person you’re solving the problem for in as specific terms as possible. This is important as this person is the one who will ultimately benefit from your solutions, and you’ll be interviewing someone who fits these criteria. This means identifying the characteristics, objectives, motives, and pain points of your target users. In the space below, define this user by creating a detailed user persona of them using the following descriptions:
Demographics: Age, gender, location, education, family status, interests, hobbies and more
Pain points: What the user might have trouble with, like being not very tech savvy. Identify at least 2.
Goals: What the user wants to achieve using your product or what are their goals with respect to the problem they’re facing.
Motivations: What motivates the user to use a product or solve their problem. How motivated are they to receive a potential solution?
Behavior: How the user might behave in the context of the problem or when a solution is presented to them.
Customer needs and wants: What the customer might need or want as a potential solution to their problem.

Step 2: User Persona









Step 3: Interview Questions
Now that you have your user persona defined, let’s prepare for the interview by defining the questions that you’ll be asking during the interview. To do so, provide the list of questions that intend to ask during the interview in the space below. These questions should help you understand the problem and how it affects the target users better. Write down at least 5 primary questions that you’re going to ask.

Step 3: Interview Questions

SECTION B: User Interview Insights
Step 1: Interviewee Information
Please write the name and other details of the interviewee you interviewed for the information.

Step 1: Interviewee Information
Interviewee Name:
Interviewee Occupation:
Interviewee Age & Location:




Step 2: Interview Insights
What did you learn from the interview? Provide the main points that you gathered through the interview about your problem. On the whole, what was new that you learnt about your problem and its effect on people? What were the most pressing concerns and pain points mentioned in the interviews? What recommendations did you receive from the interviewees about possible solutions? Did you uncover any new factors surrounding the problem that you didn't consider before? All in all, identify at least 5 major themes with details.

Step 2: Interview Insights










SECTION C: Generating Solutions
Step 1: Meeting Date, Time, & Location
Please list when and where your team meeting took place.

Step 1: Meeting Date, Time, & Location
Date:

Step 2: Meeting Attendees
Please list who attended your team meeting, and their primary role.

Step 3: Bad Idea Brainstorm
It’s time to start thinking about solutions to the problem. Use all the information you now have about the problem (from your research last week and the interviews this week) to start thinking of possible solutions. As you have studied in Canvas modules, it’s always good to first gather as many ideas as possible. So at this stage, don’t hold back, put your divergent thinking hat on, and let the creativity flow to gather as many ideas as possible. As a team, you must generate at least 10 new bad ideas. Remember, the dumber the idea, the better! This is to help you work as a team to be non-critical. Stay in divergent thinking. It helps to say “thank you” after every idea is shared.

Step 3: Brainstormed Ideas

12.



Step 4: Team’s Final Selected Solution Idea
Your next task is to narrow your choices, which will put you in a convergent thinking mindset. You should have some discussion and debate about this, and try to reach a consensus on a final solution to your problem that your team is going to consider working on for the rest of Month 2. These ideas can be totally new, or they can be the same or variations from ideas you’ve already come up with. Remember that they should involve some sort of technology (either a piece of software like an app or algorithm, or a physical device such as a robotic fish or machine that scans your DNA). You will not have to build the solution out. But you will have to create some type of basic prototype (if it is a device) or a set of wireframes (if it is an app/software). You will not have to actually create the technology or code.

You must figure out a fair way to reach a consensus with your group, including a discussion where everyone’s voice can be heard.

Step 4: Team’s Final Selected Solution Idea





SECTION D: Product Planning
Step 1: Product Description
You learnt about product planning and product descriptions in Weeks 4 and 5. Now it’s time to apply that learning to create these descriptions to plan for your solution. In the space below, describe the solutions that you’re building, in as much detail as possible. Ask yourself the following questions:
What does the ideal solution look like? Will it be an app or a physical item or a software service? What will it look like aesthetically?
How the ideal solution will function, and how will users interact with it? Will the users create profiles? Will there be a dashboard (and what will it show)? Will there be other forms of screens or interactions that users will perform? How will users operate the product?
What will be the features of the solution? How will you define and describe these features and how will users access these features on the app or physical product?

Step 1: Product Description








Step 2: Product Solution
Before we finalize everything for the week, it’s also important to very clearly define how your product is going to solve the problem that you set out to solve. You can do so by answering the following questions:
What specifics about the product or app contribute to solving the problem?
How do these specific features contribute to solving the problem?
How does the product help the people you’re creating the solution for?

Step 2: Product Solution








Step 3: Reflections (Individual)
Please share your personal reflections on your experience with your team so far.

Step 3: Team Process Reflections
What is working well with your team?

What is one good thing that happened during your team meeting?

What is one thing your team could do better in the next meeting?

Are you experiencing any concerns or frustrations with your team? If yes, what can you personally do to lessen the concern/frustration?

How would you rate your ability to communicate with your team members on a scale of 1 to 4? (1=extremely poor and 4=excellent)

Overall, how satisfied are you with how well your team is working together? (On a scale of 1 to 4, with 1=extremely poor and 4=excellent)

Is there anything else you’d like to share about your team and their process?

# Daily 3 Tracker

That’s right, just keep tracking!
So please tell us how you are doing with your Daily 3 by answering the following questions:

What aspirations do you have about each aspect of the Daily 3?

Which aspect of the Daily 3 has been particularly achievable for you? Which has not been achievable?

If you have partnered with peers to complete the Daily 3 together, how is it going? If not, what is preventing you from finding a peer?

For the Daily 3 aspect that has been hard to achieve, how can you achieve it THIS week?

What might you do differently next week to keep your Daily 3 activities going?

Doing the Daily 3 is its own reward, but are there additional rewards you can give yourself if you meet your goals?

What are other creative ways to sustain motivation and inspiration to ensure you continue practising the Daily 3 in the long term?

Take a moment to share one aspiration that you have for any of your Daily 3 with your squad (bigger community) on the Portal. You could share by saying something along the lines of “My aspiration for Movement is to join Saturday morning workout session at the gym.” or “My hope is to set aside 10 minutes every day to quiet the mind and meditate.”

# Refresher: Morning Pages


Let’s not forget about incorporating [Morning Pages](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/102496) into our daily routine! We shared some of the immense benefits of writing Morning Pages in Week 1 and we want you to feel equipped to make them a part of your day-to-day.

The most critical thing is that you write a little something by hand, and that you do it everyday!
We challenge you to do your morning pages everyday for the next 7 days!

One thing that is really important to remember with morning pages is that what you write matters a lot less than the fact that you write something. So make sure you give yourself permission to write absolutely anything. Don’t overthink it. Just write. Think of it as “clearing out the pipes” so that you have more space to do focused and creative work.

Here are some benefits of Morning Pages:
They provoke, clarify, prioritize, and comfort!

They clear your mind

They help you discover creativity!

They make you less anxious

They are good idea generators!

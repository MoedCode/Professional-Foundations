# A Clearer Picture of You


As a tech professional, you are ultimately selling “you” as a solution to an organization’s problems. So knowing in detail who you are – what motivates you, what you’re passionate about, what you’re good at, what your areas for growth are, what your personality is like – is really important! It will allow you to choose the jobs that fit your skills and personality well. It will help you talk about yourself in a meaningful way to potential employers or clients. Knowing yourself well is also a signal to others that you are mature and self-aware – very desirable traits of a young tech leader!

We’ve curated a set of free assessment tools to help you get a more detailed look at yourself.

First is a personality test:

based on the Myers-Briggs type sorter, which evaluates your personality on 4 dimensions. There is no better or worse way to score on this “test”– it is just information to help you better understand yourself and perhaps inspire you about potential careers.

Here is what you need to do:

Based on the outcome – and as a fun read – take a look at this article by Job Street Malaysia:
https://www.jobstreet.com.my/career-resources/plan-your-career/what-is-the-best-it-job-for-your-mbti-personality-type/

 that speaks on the different tech careers by personality types. You can pursue any career and work in any industry as a tech professional. The career suggestions are by no means prescriptive, they only provide a glance into the vast opportunities you can pursue.

After you have taken the test, share your results (or even just one thing about your results) and your reflections with your Squad on The Portal. What felt accurate? What surprised you?

These are optional but likely informative and fun. The better you know yourself, the more meaningfully you can map your career trajectory and engage with potential employers or clients.

# No! We are not talking about your social media pics, so you can put that camera away, read on and understand our version of PICS.

Self-awareness is a lifelong journey, and the “picture of you” in your mind becomes clearer and clearer as you collect more experiences and continue on your personal journey.

But how, then, can you make decisions on the first steps of your careers, if you are still uncertain as to what your life paths should be, or what your strong points are?


A tool that you can use here to help determine what you like and what you are good at is called “P.I.C.S.” – Passions, Interests, Causes and Strengths.

Passions: What would you get out of bed for in the morning if money wasn’t an issue?
Interests: What are you most curious about?
Causes: What keeps you up at night?
Strengths: What are your superhero powers?
Answering these will help you to continue to interrogate and evaluate the path you want to take and the difference you want to make to society as a young leader and change-maker.

Okay, ready to give it a try? Let’s work on your PICS in the activity on the next page.

# A Clearer Picture of You


As a tech professional, you are ultimately selling “you” as a solution to an organization’s problems. So knowing in detail who you are – what motivates you, what you’re passionate about, what you’re good at, what your areas for growth are, what your personality is like – is really important! It will allow you to choose the jobs that fit your skills and personality well. It will help you talk about yourself in a meaningful way to potential employers or clients. Knowing yourself well is also a signal to others that you are mature and self-aware – very desirable traits of a young tech leader!

We’ve curated a set of free assessment tools to help you get a more detailed look at yourself.

First is a personality test:
```

```
based on the Myers-Briggs type sorter, which evaluates your personality on 4 dimensions. There is no better or worse way to score on this “test”– it is just information to help you better understand yourself and perhaps inspire you about potential careers.

Here is what you need to do:

Based on the outcome – and as a fun read – take a look at this article by Job Street Malaysia:

```
 that speaks on the different tech careers by personality types. You can pursue any career and work in any industry as a tech professional. The career suggestions are by no means prescriptive, they only provide a glance into the vast opportunities you can pursue.

After you have taken the test, share your results (or even just one thing about your results) and your reflections with your Squad on The Portal. What felt accurate? What surprised you?

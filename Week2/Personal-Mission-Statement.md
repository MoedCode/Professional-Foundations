# Let's Review


Now that you have your personal mission statement sorted, is that it? Well, like we mentioned before, your personal mission statement is something that you will continue to work and build upon as you move forward. So now it’s time to review the mission statement that you wrote. And what better way to do this review, than to take help from a fellow learner who is working on something of their own. Remember what we said about going together?

“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go further, go together!”

- African Proverb

So in the next activity, you will find someone from your circle on The Portal, and get together to review each others’ mission statements. In this page, we want to share a few tips that you can use to make this feedback session more effective.

Giving Effective Feedback
Feedback is a crucial aspect of learning and growth, both academically and professionally. As you embark on your journey at ALX Professional Foundations, mastering the art of giving and receiving feedback will be invaluable to your success. This guide is designed to equip you with the skills and techniques necessary to engage in constructive feedback exchanges with your peers.

1. Understanding the Purpose of Feedback:
Feedback serves as a tool for improvement, not criticism. It should aim to highlight strengths and provide actionable suggestions for growth.
Keep in mind that feedback is a two-way street. By giving thoughtful feedback, you contribute to the growth of your peers, and by receiving feedback graciously, you open yourself up to continuous improvement.
2. Preparing to Give Feedback:
Before providing feedback, take the time to thoroughly review your peer’s work. Understand the context, objectives, and criteria for evaluation.
Identify both strengths and areas for improvement. Be specific and provide examples to support your observations.
Consider the impact of your feedback and strive to maintain a constructive and supportive tone throughout.
3. Delivering Feedback Effectively:
Start with positive feedback to acknowledge strengths and build rapport.
Be specific about areas that need improvement and offer actionable suggestions for enhancement.
Use “I” statements to express your thoughts and avoid sounding accusatory or judgmental.
Provide examples or evidence to illustrate your points and make your feedback more tangible.
4. Receiving Feedback Gracefully:
Approach feedback with an open mind and a willingness to learn.
Listen actively without interrupting or becoming defensive. Seek clarification if needed.
Reflect on the feedback provided and consider how you can incorporate it into your work to improve.
Express gratitude to your peer for their insights and acknowledge the value of their feedback.
5. Engaging in Dialogue:
Encourage open communication by asking clarifying questions and seeking additional input.
Foster a collaborative environment where both parties feel comfortable expressing their thoughts and opinions.
Be receptive to feedback on your feedback. Use it as an opportunity to refine your communication skills and deepen your understanding.
6. Follow-Up and Implementation:
After receiving feedback, take the time to review and digest the insights provided.
Develop an action plan to address the areas for improvement identified in the feedback.
Monitor your progress and seek further feedback as needed to gauge your growth and development.
Remember, the goal of feedback exchange is not perfection but progress. Embrace the opportunity to learn from one another and support each other’s journey toward excellence. By honing your feedback skills, you not only enhance your own learning experience but also contribute to the growth and development of your peers.

Happy feedback exchanging!

General Guidelines
Remember your commitment to the Honor Code. You cannot copy and submit a peer’s work as your own. If you do that you are breaking ethical expectations and hampering your learning and growth. Be trustworthy and trust your peers to do the same.

Activity
Here is what you need to do this week:

1. Set aside a time to find 1-2 peers to do this activity with online, on the Portal or at your nearest City Hub. The activity will take you about 60 minutes in total. (You can do this on the same day that you do your peer coaching activity which is outlined in the next module.

If you prefer, one of the peers you work with on this activity can be the same peer you have a peer coaching session with.

2. Once you have identified your peers to work with, set up a Zoom/Google Meet call with them or set up a time to meet in person at the ALX City Hub.

3. Ask for your peers’ full name. You will need to write them down here in Canvas as part of your reflection. You will work together and share/declare your Personal Mission Statements with each other.

4. Declare your Personal Mission Statement to your peers. You must:

Talk about your strengths
Talk about your area of growth
Read out and declare your Personal Mission Statement
Show a picture that represents your mission statements. (No need to print; you can search for a picture, save it and show it to your peers from your computer)
5. Ask each of them to repeat what you just shared in their own words. This is to be sure that your peers have understood you.

6. Ask your peers if they have any questions about your Personal Mission Statement and Answer them.

7. After the conversation, thank your peers for their time and swap positions until all of you have shared your personal mission and done the above exercise.

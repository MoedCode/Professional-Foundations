# Introduction to Personal Mission Statements
“Speed is irrelevant if you’re going in the wrong direction.”

- Mahatma Gandhi

Before delving into the details of personal mission statements and how to build one, let’s take time to understand why it is important to have a personal mission statement.

Let’s start by watching this powerful video on how creating a personal mission statement saved David Anderson. While watching the video, ask yourself:

What is greatness and what does it mean to me?
What did great influential people in the world have in common?
How have my experiences influenced my Passions, Interests, Causes, and Skills?
What do I pledge allegiance to?

So now we know why a Personal Mission Statement is a must-have, pay attention to this video on How To Create A Powerful Mission Statement For Your Life. As you listen ask yourself:

What are the guidelines for a powerful and inspiring mission statement?
How can I apply the “Do-Be-Give” principle in my life?

Let’s use the next few lessons to summarize everything about writing a personal mission statement in clear actionable steps. Summing up who you are and what you want out of life in a sentence or two can be a little intimidating. But don’t worry, all the best personal mission statement examples will - and should - change over time as experiences shape who you are. The important thing is to just get started.

Here’s how to write a personal mission statement in no time.
1. Schedule some quiet time to just write
Do this once a day for a week
Maybe this is just for 5 minutes or you get into it and find that you need 30 minutes or more. Simply, make sure that you schedule this time for when you aren’t rushed and can focus on just this.

2. Start with a question, and write/ type your responses down and save them. You can choose a few of the questions below, or create new ones. Great questions to ask are:
What’s important to me?
What do I want my legacy to be?
What does my ideal day look like?
Who would I do anything for?
What am I grateful for?
When do I feel the calmest?
What makes me feel powerful?
What makes me different from other people?
When do I feel most useful?
What makes me feel alive?
What do I wish I made more time to do?
What am I great at?
What’s something I haven’t done that I want to do before I die?
If I had an extra hour each day, how would I fill it?
Who inspires me? Why?
Who do I want to inspire? Why?
What am I most proud of?
What do I pledge allegiance to (what am I committed to beyond doubt)?
What am I inspired to be, do and give?
The list can go on forever, and your questions can be as broad or as specific as you want. The point of this exercise is to get you to reflect on who you are now, who you want to become and what you’re willing to do to get there. Use concrete examples when you can, and don’t judge your own answers.

3. Repeat step two, by asking yourself the same question again for a few days.
Do not look at your responses from the previous days, just answer each question afresh. Each time, write (or type) your responses down and save them.

4. Review your entries after you’ve been answering the questions in step 2 for a few days
Look at all your answers from each day you did the exercise. What patterns are continuously emerging? Is anything standing out as a top goal? How does that connect to your greater purpose? Use these entries to figure out your life’s priorities. These should be priorities for your professional life, your personal life, and your own passions and interests. You can also name a top priority for who you are physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

5. Make a statement
Now that you’ve reviewed these entries, you should be ready to craft your own personal mission statement. You will need to write a personal mission statement that recognizes your values and identifies how you intend to use those talents. If you don’t feel ready to draft your personal mission statement just yet, continue to steps 5 and 6.

6. Hung up on identifying “the value you create”?
Just ask around. Look to people who really know you and people who you spend a lot of time with, in different contexts. These could be close friends, relatives, colleagues, teachers and mentors. Ask them what you do well or what they see in you as a person, professional and future leader. Ask for specifics, especially when it comes to less tangible skills – like charisma or creating a supportive environment.

7. Look to your idols
Research the people that you admire to see how they live their lives, and what practices helped them along the way. Do some detective work to find some examples of personal mission statements from the people that you look up to. There’s a good chance that you’ll find something. There’s no reason for you to copy their mission statement word for word, but hopefully, it will inspire you to write your own.

# Example of Personal Mission Statements
Here are some noteworthy Examples of Personal Mission Statements from 13 CEOs

Your personal mission statement is important, so dedicate the time that it deserves. Even if it isn’t perfect, do your best and remember that you can revise your statement as needed. To see how to write a personal mission statement up close, and for more inspiration, take a look at some of these examples:

Denise Morrison, Campbell Soup Company, “To serve as a leader, live a balanced life, and apply ethical principles to make a significant difference.”
Gloria Horsley, Open To Hope, “To help people find hope after loss"
Amanda Steinberg, Dailyworth.com, “To use my gifts of intelligence, charisma, and serial optimism to cultivate the self-worth and net worth of women around the world.”
Oprah Winfrey, OWN, “To be a teacher. And to be known for inspiring my students to be more than they thought they could be.”
Richard Branson, The Virgin Group, “To have fun in my journey through life and learn from my mistakes.”
Amy Ziari, Pasta” “To live life with integrity and empathy, and be a positive force in the lives of others.”
Sanjeev Saxena, POC Medical, "To develop next-generation diagnostics to provide a better life.”
Katie Arnold, Talk Less, Say More, “To constantly be striving to be the best version of myself—in my job, with my health and fitness, with my relationships with family and friends, and with my emotional well-being.”
Jonathan Kaplan, Build My Bod, “Transparency = Success”
Joel Manby, Herschend Family Entertainment, “I define personal success as being consistent to my own personal mission statement: To love God and love others.”.
John Rampton, Hostt.com, “I want to make it so that every person in the world can afford to start their own business.”
Makeda Pennycooke, Business Strategies, “Through faith, vulnerability and an anchoring presence, I hold space for others to courageously risk revealing their messy, broken pieces; discover the redemptive power of grace, and stand in their most authentic truth so they may unravel into their best selves.“
Craig Clark, Pillows, "You have to be willing to venture where nobody else is willing to go as well as provide a service that everyone needs.”
These have been refined over time. Your first personal mission statement, which you are about to do, will probably be a bit lengthy. This is to allow you to explore a bit more and capture as much as you can in one place about the things that matter to you. Your personal mission statement will become clear, succinct and simple the more you revise and refine it over time.

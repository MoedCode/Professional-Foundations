# 4 Aspects of Emotional Intelligence
Before you proceed, name the 4 aspects of Emotional Intelligence. How did you do?
Let’s recap the video.

Emotional intelligence is the process of understanding and facilitating emotions into rational thought.

The 4 aspects of emotional intelligence as mentioned in the previous video are:

Ability to perceive others’ emotions: for example, knowing if the other person is feeling overwhelmed so that you can adapt your communication accordingly.
Understanding others’ emotions and their associated patterns: for example, knowing when a potential client might be most likely to accept an offer you make.
Using emotions to facilitate your thoughts: for example, knowing when you’re feeling anxious or nervous so that you don’t let it affect your judgment going into an interview.
Managing your own emotions: for example, the ability to manage disappointment, so that you can continue to make progress and not be discouraged by one failure.

# Emotional Intelligence Expanded
Our society uses different terms and approaches to explain the same concept. This makes it easier for everyone to understand it.

Harvard Business Review defines these 4 categories of Emotional Intelligence as awareness of self, managing self, awareness of others, and managing others. This is very helpful in categorizing our daily actions and making better decisions. These 4 elements are then further subdivided. Take a look at the chart below. Read each term and ask yourself what you think it means.



Now, think about each aspect and rate how well you think you do on each one, on a scale of 1 to 5.

If your curiosity is ignited, and want to learn more about each of these elements, we highly recommend you read this optional HBR article on Emotional Intelligence.

How does self-awareness relate to leadership?

He expands on the difficulties of acknowledging flaws and fixing them and then makes the case for why we must develop self-awareness.

As you read Jun’s article, make sure you understand:|:

Why self-awareness is important.
Why the pursuit of self-awareness is so complex
